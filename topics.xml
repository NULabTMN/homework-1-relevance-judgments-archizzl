          <text>Philadelphia, Nov. 18 – Following the death of R.H. Holmes, also known as Howard, in Boston, a major insurance fraud scheme has been uncovered by detectives from the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Association.

            On September 3, a man's body was found at 1319 Callowhill Street in Philadelphia and was initially identified by the coroner as H.J. Pitezel. However, it has now come to light that this body was a substitute used in a plot to defraud the insurance company of $10,000.

            Attorney Howe, from St. Louis, appeared in Philadelphia with a young girl, claiming she was the daughter of the deceased. The insurance company, after exhuming the body to confirm its identity, was satisfied with the claim and reburied it. Attorney Howe then collected $10,000, the amount owed to Mrs. Pitezel.

            A month ago, an agent from the insurance company, while in St. Louis, learned key information that revealed a conspiracy. It turns out that Holmes and Pitezel had a relationship as lawyer and client. Holmes had been previously arrested under the alias H.M. Howard for obtaining goods under false pretenses. Further investigation showed that Holmes and Pitezel had worked together in Chicago during the World’s Fair, running a hotel where they used secret rooms to hide goods they had swindled from merchants. This hotel was called the “World’s Fair Hotel.”

            During this time, Pitezel took out an insurance policy with the Fidelity company, and Holmes followed suit a month later, both using promissory notes for the first payment. After some investigation, it was discovered that Holmes and Pitezel obtained a corpse from a New York hospital, brought it to Philadelphia, staged the death at the Callowhill Street house, and collected the $10,000 payout. Holmes was arrested in Boston, and detectives are now pursuing the other conspirators involved.</text>

          Story —Lawyer Uowe
          Missing.
          By the Associated Press,
          Philadelphia, Nov. 20.—Tbe arch
          conspirator, H. H. Holmes, accompa
          nied by Mrs. Pitzel and a pretty woman
          who calls herself Mrs. Holmes, arrived
          in this city today in the custody of De
          tective Crawford and Special Agent Perry
          •of the Fidelity Mutual Life association.
          Mrs. Piizel's 16 year old daughter, Meda,
          and her 1-year-old bay were also with
          the party. Mrs. Holmes disappeared
          soon after her arrival, and no clue to her
          whereabouts could be obtained. It is
          thought she is stopping at a hotel in the
          neighborhood of police headquarters.
          After tbe arrival, tbe party was
          closeted with Superintendent of Police
          Linden until late in the afternoon.
          When the conference was over. Detective
          Crawford detailed the story of tbe trip,
          tbe moat important feature of which
          was the relation by Mr. Holmes of the
          story of bis whole life. It reads like
          tbe moat sensational of romances.
          Holmes Bat beside tbe detective with
          handcuffs on. The train had scarcely
          emerged from the Boston depot before
          lie iried to bribe hie captor. He offered
          the detective $000 if ho would allow him
          to escape. He said he had frequently
          hypnotized persons, having acquired the
          r.rt from a coliege professor in the west.
          He said he could get the money from
          his wife or Mrs. Pitzel. Wben ho caw
          his words had no effect, he entered into
          general conversation aud told the story
          of hia life.
          He said he was raised in Burlington,
          Vermont, and was co well educated in
          the schools that at 15 he was a tencher.
          For some time afterward he went to
          collegia there and later in Detroit, Micb.
          Here he formed the acquaintance of a
          medical student, who, he said, fur
          nished the body in New York in the
          present caee. He refused to divulge
          hie name. During vacations tbey wonted
          on farrae to ruiee their college expeuees.
          but one summer tbey found theuiGelves
          without means, and then the medical
          man suggested the idea of getting a
          body and beating nn insurance com
          pany. This was 12 years ago.
          The doctor got his life insured for
          $12,000. They obtained a body in Chi
          cago, took it east, arranged the details
          id identification and successfully got !
          the money with which they continued j
          their studies. He refused to name the -
          company thus swindled. They worked
          the scheme afterwards with sncceis,
          obtaining sums ranging from $10 000 to
          $20,000.
          j Once Holmes got bis life insured for
          [ $20,000 He then went to a hotel in
          Rhode Inland. At that time be wore a
          beard. He secured a corpse in Chicago,
          cut off the head and took tbo body to a
          lonely spot not far from tbe hotel.' Then
          he ehaved off his beard, returned to the
          hotel, asked for Holrr.es and engaged a
          room to wait for him. He bad brought
          the head with him and burned it be
          yond recognition in the fireplace of the
          hotel. This scheme, however, fell
          through, the mother of big wife, when
          she discovered the scheme, threatening
          to tell tbe police, and Holmes fled to
          the west.
          Resuming his story he said that while
          living in Chicago about 18 months ago,
          he tell in with a type-writer girl and
          furnished a house on the outskirts
          where tbey lived together. A younger
          sister came to visit them and the
          woman grew so jealous of her that in a
          quarrel one day she struck her over
          the head with a etool and killed her.
          To save the woman with whom he
          lived, Holmes said he put the body in
          a trunk loaded with stones and sunk
          it in the lake.
          This girl had property in Texas, and
          he and Pitzel took it off her hands and
          sent her abroad. It waa worth, he said,
          $40,000, and after getting it in their
          hands they went through Texas buying
          carloads of horses on notes on this prop
          erty, but as they never had a legal title
          to the property, the notes were worth
          less, and it is for this affair they are
          wanted in Fort Worth. To save this
          property Holmes said he and Pitzel
          formed tbo scheme of swindling the Fi
          delity company. He told the detective
          that for the crimes he had committed
          he deßerved to be hanged a dozen
          times.
          Holmes is not lacking for money, as
          he himself admitted that at the present
          time he ih supporting nearly two dozen
          persons, including the girl murderess,
          her mother and an imbecile brother,
          two orphans in Chicago who live in one
          of his properties, three separate alleged
          wiveß and their children rtnd his own
          mother and father in Kankakee. He
          would not give the names of the women.
          He firmly maintained that Pitzel ie
          alive and in Snn Salvador, and that he
          will hear from him through the personal
          column of a certain newepaper,
          Mr. Ferry said that ac a result of the
          interview it had been decided to arrest
          a number of other persona whose names
          were not ready to be given out.
          Mr. Perry related in detail the story
          of Holmes' arrest in Boston and the
          manner in which Mrs. Pitzel was de
          coyed from Burlington. He said tbat in
          the secret conference today nothing had
          been said that would in tbe slightest
          degree refute his original theory that
          Pitzel had been murdered. Wben in
          the west be saw tbe parents of Mrs.
          Pitzel, and tbey told him their daugh
          ter had complained of the exorbitant
          fee charged by the St. Loniß lawyer—
          $2500. In corroboration of his murder
          theory, Mr. Perry said tbat he had from
          Mrs. Pitzel an exact description of
          her husband, agreeing in every respect
          with that of the corpse found in the
          Oallowhill street hoose. Mrs, Pitzel, he
          continued, was perfectly innocent of
          any complicity in the whole affair. She
          told Perry last night that she had re
          ceived only $5000 in cash. She said
          Holmeß had taken $5000 of the money
          and put it in a speculation in Port
          Worth in which Pitz9l was also Inter
          ested. Holmes told Perry that this was
          true. In Texas, Perry said, Holmes
          operated under the name of H. H.
          Pratt. He added that Pitzel and B. T.
          Lyman are one and tbe same man.
          MRS. PITZEL'S STORY.
          Hho Fairs Bar Hmliiud Is Really Dead.
          M-r Daughter Missing.
          Boston. Nov. 20.—Mrs. Carrie Pitiel,
          it is claimed, has made a full confession
          of the alleged insurance swindle. It is
          stated that she hae implicated Holmeß,
          at whose suggestion, it is claimed, she
          went to Burlington, Vt. She stated
          that Holmee substituted tbe alleged
          bogus body for that of her husband and
          collected the insurance, but she was
          kept in ignorance of the whereabouts
          of her husband, who disappeared at
          once. Since the affair she has been
          roaming round from place to place,
          prompted by Holmee, in eearcti of her
          hueband, and it waa through the hope
          that she would be sent to him that Bhe
          answered the telegrams of the detec
          tives. Now ahe fears that the body for
          which the insurance was paid was not a
          bogus one, but that of her hnsband.
          Mrs. Pitzel aleo fears that her daugh
          ter, Alice, who was the only one besides
          Holmes t > identify tha body, has been
          spirited away, as Bhe has completely
          disappeared and Holmes is the last one
          known to have seen her. Holmes as
          serts be left Alice and tbe other Pitzel
          children at their father's home in
          Detroit a month ago, and since then has
          heard nothing from him.
          Holmee further stand that wben he
          came to Boston on 'Tuesday last be in
          tended to take paesage for Berlin, but
          changed his mind, and before he could
          perfect other plana the detectives bad
          him.
          HOLMES' VICTIMS.
          Good Reason to Believe He Murdered
          tbe Williams Sisters.
          Fort Worth, Tex., Nov. 20.—There is
          every reason to bolieve that C. H.
          Holmee, who went by tbe name of O. C.
          Pratt in Fort Worth, ia guilty of mur
          dering Minnie X, Wiliiame und her sis
          ter Ann. The crime waa probably com
          mitted in Chicago, and in this crime a
          man who claimed here to be a
          citizen of Chicago and called himself
          Benton T. Lyman, is an accomplice,
          Some time iv February be came here
          from Chicago and placed on record a
          deed from one Bond to Lyman for ICO
          feet front on Husk und Second etreete.
          Bond got title by deed from Minnie
          R. Wiliiame, executed before a no
          tary, whoan name was said to be
          HolmeD. Oa this property Lyman
          beaaii the erection of a three-story
          huilding. Lyman had sold one lot to a
          Fort Worth citizen who, fearing the title
          wae clouded, began to invest gate. He
          found that Minnie R. Wiliiame wrote
          late in 1803 to her sister Miss Ann Wil
          ium*, of Midlothian, Texas, to come to
          Chicago, tnat she v. a a going to bs mar
          ried and go to Europo. The sister left
          for Chicago. No word ever came from
          either of tbe Bistere.
          Minnie K. Williams, by will, was left
          half a block of property in tbe heart of
          Fort Worth, valued at $60,000, and a
          farm valued at $15,000. Thiß property
          has all been alienated, ostensibly by
          Miss Wiliiame. A detective has recent
          ly been sent to find the girls, but no
          trace can be discovered.

            Third Woman Victim
            Discovered.
            By the Associated Press,
            Philadelphia, Nov. 21. —The Pitzel
            mystery deepens as time wears on. To
            day many theories in regard to the mys
            tery were knocked in the head by tbe
            announcement tbat 13. F. Pitzel, the
            supposed murdered man, was seen in
            Chicago less than two weeks ago. Pres
            ident Fouzof the Fidelity Life Insurance
            company said today:
            "This morning my Chicago represen
            tative telegraphed me tbat a Mr. Bryan,
            who is a bueiness man in Chicago, called
            on him and said that B. F. Pitzel was
            in tbat city less than two weeke ago.
            Mr. Bryan says be bas known Pitzel for
            many years, and had frequent business
            transactions with him, and it is impos
            sible fot him to be mietaken. When
            they met, Bryan did not know Pitzel
            wae euppoeed to be dead, and tbe two
            greeted each otber cordially and re
            paired to a near-by ealoon where they
            bad a drink together. Then tbey sep
            arated and Bryant saye he doee not
            know whether Pitzel was to remain in
            thecity or not. However, our men there
            and tbe Pinkerton detectives have taken
            up the clew, and it is my opinion that
            Pitzel will be produced within a few
            dayp."
            President Fcuz called on Mrs. Pitzel
            and her daughter at tbe Central station,
            tiday, and received valuable informa
            tion Irom tbe daughter in reference to
            her father. The daughter said she re
            numbered while walking with her fa
            ther one Sunday in Chicago that tbat
            latter bad said to her: "If you ever hear
            through the newspapers or any otber
            way tbat I iiave been found dead, do not
            believe it. I will be all right."
            Later on, while in Boson, she read
            the story ot her father's death in a news
            paper. As soon as she had finished the
            etory, Holmes said to her: "Do you re
            member what your father told you the
            afternoon you were walking in Chi
            cago?"
            Daring Mr. Fouz'e interview with the
            daughter, Mrs. Pilzal grew excited and
            exclaimed : "They have all deceived me,
            even my own daughter."
            Mrs. Pitzsl said she remembered re
            ceiving a letter from her daughter Alice
            in which she related her experience
            while coming east for the purpose of
            identifying her father's body. Alice
            etated that Howe and Holmes accom
            panied her and both were sociable with
            each otber on the trip east. This eets
            at reet the claim of Howe that be never
            met Holmes until introduced to him by
            President Fouz on hia arrival in this
            city.

            ANOTHER WOMAN VICTIM.
            Chicago, Nov. 21. —Following cloae on
            tbe atory of tbe mysterious disappear
            ance of the Wiliiame aiatera at tbe hands
            of Holmee, tbe life inenrance swindler,
            comes a (iiird woman victim, namely
            Miss Kate Durkee. Miss Durkee had
            property. Documents representing the
            property came into the bands of H. H.
            Holmes by theft. The woman mysteri
            ously disappeared, and Holmes showed
            title to the property. Mies Durkee was
            not Miss Williams; she bad dark eyes
            aud hair, while Miss Williams waa a
            blonde. A year ago today 25 creditors
            oi H. H. Holmes met at tbe office of
            George B. Chamberlain and made a des
            perate effort to find out who and where
            Miss Durkee was. It waa supposed she
            was an accomplice of Holmes; tbat
            property, illegally obtained waa being
            trauaferred to her name. Tbe creditors
            wished to reach it. Suddenly Kate Dur
            kee dropped entirely from sight, like
            tbe Williams sisters, and left no trace
            behind.
            "I believe she waa murdered," said
            Chamberlain today. "I believe also
            tbat both Williams girls wore mur
            dered."
            Mr. Chamberlain, as proprietor of the
            Lafayette Mercantile agency, began an
            investigation of Holmee a year ago.

            this city witb ber brother, who is
            assistant auditor of tbe Burlington rail
            road. She expreeeed aurpriee wben
            asked concerning ber connection with
            Holmes' family in Chicago. She never
            heard of but one wife. Hie recently
            visited Mrs. Holraea and made Holmee
            transfer a piece of property in Chicago for
            ber. She refused to explain what prop
            erty this was, hut declared that Holmes'
            Chicago lawyer was familiar with the
            deal.
            Attorney Duncombe of this city said:
            "Holmes employed me to attend to
            some business for him, and in the courae
            of the action for which I waa retained it
            became necessary to take the deposition
            of Miss Kate Durkee. In her evidence
            she eaid she waa related to the wife of
            Holmeß."
            Mr. Duncombe said he had frequently
            seen Pitzel in company with Holmes
            and that ho would know whether ttie

          <text>Bodies of the Murdered
            Pietzel Girls Found
            in Toronto.
            THREE FIENDISH CRIMES.
            The Notorious H. H. Holmes
            Accused of Taking Their
            Lives.
            RECORD OF MANY KILLINGS.
            It Is Thought the Insurance Swin
            dler Had Murdered the Elder
            Pietzel.
            TORONTO, Ont., July 15.— The bodies
            of Etta, Alice and Hettie Pietzel, the miss
            ing daughters of Benjamin F. Pietzel,
            were found by Detective Cuddy of Toronto
            and Detective Greyer of Philadelphia, to
            day, buried in the cellar of the house
            No. 16 St. Vincent street. H. H. Holmes,
            now under arrest at Philadelphia, is be
            lieved to have deliberately murdered the
            girls after he had first murdered their
            father in Philadelphia and their brother in
            Detroit.
            Inquiries began by the police to-day and
            led to the knowledge that Holmes and the
            children lived at the house in question,
            and search was made by the two ottioers.
            A photograph of Holmes was shown to
            Frank N. Nudel of the Ontario Educational
            Department, who owns No. 16 St. Vincent
            street, and without hesitation he identified
            it as that of the man who had rented the
            house from him last October, and after a
            very short stay had departed.
            When they reached the cellar it appeared
            to the detectives that something had dis
            turbed the cellar floor, and arming them
            selves with shovels they began to dig. A
            short distance below the surface they came
            across the arm and a portion at the head of
            one of the girls, and further work soon re
            vealed the bodies of all of the victims.
            They were nude and apparently had lain
            there since last October.
            City Detective Inspector Stark was com
            municated with and gave instructions that
            the bodies be removed, and they were
            taken to Humphrey's undertaking estab
            lishment on Yonge street. Coroner Orr
            was informed of the ghastly discovery, and
            called an inquest to be held at Police
            Headquarters to-morrow night. It is un
            derstood that the jury will meet pro forma,
            and after viewing the bodies will adjourn
            for one week, to enable the Crown authori
            ties to work up evidence. The bodies of
            the little ones were buried three feet from
            the surface and were in a fair state of
            preservation.
            Holmes, the alleged murderer of the
            girls, is held in Philadelphia on a charge
            of conspiracy, and a nice legal point now
            presents itself. The murders have been
            committed in Canada, the accused
            must be tried within its boundaries, but
            as Holmes has pleaded guilty to one
            charge in the United States he may insist
            on being sentenced for that.
            H. H. Holmes, alias Harwam W. Mudg
            ett, alias H. H. Howard, was born in New
            Haven, Conn., and attended a medical
            school at Burlington, Vt.,and later at Ann
            Arbor, Mich. He was married at the
            latter place. He and a friend swindled an
            insurance company in Chicago om of
            $12,000 soon after graduating. They made
            another haul of $10,000 in a similar way.
            Holmes went into the drug business and
            speculated. His wife went home and he
            married another woman, with whom he
            went to California.
            Returning about a year ago, he went to
            housekeeping with the woman typewriter
            of the company, whose acquaintance he
            had formed. He tried to cheat a fire insur
            ance company out of $00,000, but failed,
            and learning that his typewriter and her
            sister had inherited $50,000 laid a scheme
            to ket the money. The sister came to live
            with them and suddenly disappeared,
            while he and Minnie, the typewriter girl,
            took up their abode at the Plaza Hotel,
            Chicago.
            Holmes next appeared in Terre Haute,
            Ind., where he bailed Pietzel out of jail.
            From there he went to Franklin, Ind.,
            where he married Miss Yoke, and they
            spent their honeymoon in Denver, where
            Holmes made $27,000 in speculation.
            At Philadelphia, later on, he and Fietzel
            played the last card. Pietzel wu insured
            in the Philadelphia Mutual for $10,000.
            On September 3 he was found dead in the
            house at 1316 Callowhill street, which he
            had rented under the name of B. F. Perry.
            His body was badly burned and the face
            was almost unrecognizable. Holmes and
            Pietzel's wife's children identified the body
            as Pietzel's, and $7500 of the insurance was
            paid over.
            Then Train-robber Hedgespeth gave the
            whole case away to Chief of Police Harri
            son because Lawyer Howe, whom he had
            got into the conspiracy, had not paid
            him the promised reward. Holmes was
            traced to Toronto, Burlington and Boston,
            and in the latter city was arrested. Mean
            while the Pietzel children haa disappeared,
            the boy being traced to Indianapolis and
            two girls to Toronto. Holmes awaits
            sentence in Philadelphia for insurance
            fraud, and the police expect to fix several
            murders on him.
            Doctors who have examined the bodies
            agree with Detective Grier's theory that
            the girls were killed by hypodermic injec
            tions of morphine. Holmes is known to
            be an expert user of injections. J

            PHILADELPHIA, Pa., July With
            the finding of the bodies of the Pietzel
            children in Toronto, a chapter in the his
            tory of one of the most sensational crim
            inal cases in the annals of this country is
            closed, and the net of the law is being
            drawn more closely " about one of
            the : boldest scoundrels . who have ever
            been arraigned at the bar of justice.
            Herman Mudgett. alias H. H. Holmes, is
            in the County Prison here awaiting sen
            tence to the confessed charge of conspiracy
            in defrauding the Fidelity Life Association
            of Philadelphia. out of $10,000 by palm
            ing off upon it a bogus body
            as that of Benjamin F. Pietzel, , a
            policy-holder of the company. The case
            exceeds in interest the most sensational
            novel ever written, and has so many sides
            to it that it ts difficult to even outline it in
            the ordinary length of a newspaper dis
            patch. ■;:
            ■ In July, 1889, tne Fidelity Life Associa
            tion issued a policy for $10,000 upon the
            life of Benjamin Pietzel. Shortly after
            this, a man giving the name of B. A.
            Perry rented a house at 1319 Cailowhill
            street, this city. In September of the
            same year a lire, shown to have been
            caused by an explosion, occurred at the
            house and the charred body of Perry was
            found.
            A short time after this Jephtha B.Howe,
            an attorney at St. Louis, presented a claim
            to the Fidelity Company for the $10,000 on
            the life of Pietzel, alleging that the man
            found in the house at 1319 Callow
            hill was Pietzel. With Howe were
            Alice, the 13-year-old daughter of Pietzel,
            and Holmes, the arch conspirator in the
            case. The body of the supposed Perry had
            beenburied in the potter's field, but was ex
            humed, and Alice and Holmes positively
            identified it as that of Pietzel. The money
            was paid to Howe and the party returned
            to St. Louis.
            Mrs. Pieteel was in St. Louis at this
            tini-', and through the representations of
            Holmes that she could aid her husband in
            furthering his interests, had consented to
            become a party to Holmes' scheme to de
            ceive the insurance company by passing
            off upon it a bogus body as that of Pietzel.
            Holmes told her that he and Pietzel had
            procured a corpse in New York and had
            had it up in the house at 1319 Cailowhill
            street and that this was the body found.
            Mrs. Pietzel believed this story, and to aid
            her husband consented to take part in the
            deception.
            The insurance company became sus
            picious, and setting detectives upon
            Holmes' track built up a case against him,
            and in November last year Holmes was
            arrested in Boston.
            A few days after Holmes' arrest Mrs.
            Pietzel was arrested in the same city and
            Howe was arrested in St. Louis. Holmes
            offered to relieve her of the burden
            of the three children. The oldest and
            the youngest child remained with Mrs.
            Pietzel and Holmes took the other three.
            Alice, Nettie and Howard. After parting
            with her children, Mrs. Pietzel has never
            been able to obtain from Holmes any defi
            nite Knowledge of their whereabouts.

            Hair Found in a Bed of
            Clay.
            CHICAGO, July 27. — More con
            clusive evidence than has heretofore
            been collected by the police in the
            Holmes case was revealed by the
            investigation tonight. Inspector
            Fitzpatrick believes it to be certain
            that at least three murders were
            committed in the "castle" of Holmes,
            and through witnesses that were
            found today it is believed Holmes
            can now be convicted of murder in
            this city. The police have found a
            man, whose name they refuse to di
            vulge, but who was brought to the
            office of the inspector this afternoon
            by Lieut. Thomas and Officer Foley,
            of the Cottage Grove avenue sta
            tion. He told the police that he had
            mounted three skeletons for Holmes,
            and that the skeletons were from
            bodies taken from the house of
            Holmes on Sixty-third street. One
            of these he said was the body of a
            man, and the other two were wom
            en. They were taken from a dark
            room in Holmes' house in the night
            time, and two of the mounted skel
            etons were returned to Holmes. The
            flesh of the bodies had not been
            stripped from the bones when the
            bodies were given to the new wit
            ness, but the faces were so badly
            lacerated and torn that identifica
            tion would have been impossible.
            The police also found an expressman
            today who was able to give what the
            police think is important informa
            tion. The name of the expressman
            is Charles Humphrey, and in the
            month of June, 1893, he was hired
            by Holmes to deliver a box and a
            trunk at the union depot in this
            city. The box, according to Humph
            rey, was taken from a dark room
            and had the appearance of a coffin
            box. This was expressed to Phila
            delphia, while the trunk was sent
            in another direction.
            GHASTLY DETAILS.
            The story of the man who mount
            ed the skeletons is to the effect that
            in June, 1593, he was sent for by
            Holmes, who at that time was go
            ing under the alias of Gordon, and
            asked if he would articulate the
            skeleton of a man whose body was
            in the possession of Holmes. He ac
            cepted the job, and by the direction
            of Holmes he called at the house on ;
            a stipulated night. He was taken !
            by Holmes to a room which would
            have been dark even in the day
            time. Stretched out on a table in
            the middle of the room was the body
            of a man. The skin was entirely re
            moved from the face, but in all other
            respects it .*■ was in good condition.
            The articulator and Holmes had
            some talk as to the best way of get
            ting the body out of the house, as
            Holmes said he did not want the
            neighbors to see it removed. It was
            finally agreed that the articulator
            should cut off the, arms, and that
            Holmes would provide for the re- '
            moval of the rest of the ■. corpse, j
            This was done, and the articulator I
            left the house carrying the arms ;
            with him in a sack. He had just
            reached his house, and was prepar
            ing to go to bed, when ,he was
            called to the front door by a loud
            knocking. He went down and
            found Holmes and another man
            there. They had the balance of the
            body, which had been cut into two
            more pieces after, the articulator
            left the house. Holmes left, after !
            remarking that he would have an-

            other job for the man in a short
            time. True to his word, in Decem
            ber he sent for the articulator a sec
            ond time, and on the arrival of the
            latter at the house of Holmes he
            was taken to the same dark room,
            where en the same table where the
            body of a man had 'lain on the oc
            casion of his former visit, was the
            body of a young woman. The face
            of this corpse had been disfigured
            in such a manner that it was im
            possible to tell what she had looked
            like when alive. Y^YYY.Y

            I the effect that he was hired by r
            Holmes one afternoon, and told not ;
            ito come to the house until after
            i nightfall. When the expressman
            ! kept his appointment he was given
            a box and a trunk by Holmes and i
            told to take them to the union depot. i
            When he was putting the box into
            the wagon he turned it on end, and i
            I was at once stopped by Holmes, who j
            told him that he was on no account i
            to keep the box in any other posi- I
            j tion except flat on the side. The or- i
            ders were to take the trunk and box I
            • to the depot and leave them on I
            the platform, and he was told that j
            they would be taken care of. He !
            saw only one man at the depot who
            seemed to be interested in the trunk I
            and the box. After Humphrey had
            told his story to the police tonight, j
            Pat Quinlan was brought up from j
            his cell and the two were placed
            face to face. The police will not j
            tell why this was done, but the
            general opinion is that it was done
            because Humphrey recognized Quin
            lan as the man at the depot. The
            expressman will be retained in cus
            ! tody as a witness.
            HIS THIRD TRIP.
            J In January, 1893, the articulator was
            I sent for a third time by Holmes, and in
            i the same room and on the same table
            j he found the body of a second young
            i woman, from whose face all the skin
            j had been removed. The articulator
            ! had this body taken to his home, where
            j he stopped the bones and mounted the
            i skelton. When he called on Holmes
            i for his pay the latter refused to give it
            i to him, and was, moreover, somewhat
            J in arrears on the bill for mounting the
            two previous skeltons. The two men
            could not come to terms and the dis
            pute finally ended by the articulator
            j retaining possession of the third skel
            ton, and he still has it it in his house.
            j He removed the skull tonight and
            brought it to the central police station,
            I where It now Is. The articulator will
            be kept under close surveillance for
            j some days yet, as the police do not
            I think that he has told them all he
            I knows about the murder in the "cas-
            I tie." He said at first that Holmes
            j called at his house under the name of
            i Gordon, and later said that he be
            j came acquainted with Holmes through I
            j answering an advertisement for a man j
            I capable In the work of articulating
            j skeletons, and found that the advertise-
            S ment had been inserted by Holmes,
            j Afterwards he let drop some expres
            , sions that showed that he had done
            j some work for Holmes prior to the time j
            ' that he claimed his acquaintance with
            i him began. This discrepancy in his
            j story decided the police to keep a close
            . watch on him. The police declare that
            ! they have almost positive proof that
            J the first female body was that of
            I Emeline Cigrand and the second that of
            Annie Williams. It is the skull of
            . Annie Williams that is now at the
            central police station.
            J BURIED IN QUICKLIME.
            In prosecuting the investigation of
            j the basement of the big brick house on
            j Sixty-third street today the workmen
            employed by the police came upon two
            graves. The indications are that in
            | the graves were laid the bodies of Mm
            J nic and Annie Williams. Lime and
            j quicklime had accomplished their work
            j and the bodies had turned to native |
            dust, but there still remained sufficient
            evidence to make the indentificati.on
            possible. Two soft spots in a bed of |
            hard clay were the size of human bod- j
            ies, and where the heads would have I
            been were mats of long hair. One big
            strand was of light color, like that of
            Annie, while the other was of the'
            brown hue of Minnie's hair. '
            The juxtaposition of the mats of
            hair would indicate that the bodies
            had been laid side by side, the heads
            but a few inches apart. Twelve men I
            worked with picks and shovels in the !
            I rear basement of the "castle" today. '
            ) They were divided into two squads, i
            j One squad worked under the the tin i
            j shop and the other attacked the dirt |
            j bottom of the. cellar, near the rear and I
            I west walls. It was clcse to the parti- .
            | tion between the rear and front cellars,
            j under the stairs leading from the tin (
            I shop, that early in the afternoon the j
            i two masses of quicklime were found.
            I Two bones and masses of hair were
            found in them. A long, wooden, shal- '
            j low vat was found two feet under the i
            ground. It was expected that when j
            cleared out evidences that a human I
            body had been buried there would be !
            found but the examination resulted
            i in nothing of the kind. Either it was
            a blind sewer or a secret repository.
            A LETTER TO PAT.
            The police have found a letter from
            . Holmes to Pat Quinlan, to which much
            importance is attached. The letter is
            j as follows:

            asked you to do anything illegal,- but
            they are bull-headed. Oct. 13 I saw

            MURDER OF JULIA CONNOR.
            Asphyxiated, Cut Up and Cremat
            ed hy Holmes.
            CHICAGO, July 27.-Mrs. Patrick
            Quinlan lost her defiant spirit in the
            police inquisition. Two days' "sweat-
            DOX experience proved more than she
            £m I»v.beai;1 »v. beai ;. wit equanimity, and she
            told the police things which before had
            not been acknowledged. Chief of Po
            lice Badenoch said: Evidence secured
            from Mrs. Quinlan is highly important,
            fahe confessed to abetting Holmes in
            insurance swindles, and that is a step
            in the right direction. Patrick Quin
            lan, her husband, continues to protest
            he was a mere hireling, and roes not
            know Holmes' affairs at all. Mrs. Quin
            lan s evidence was that, after Mrs.
            Connor s disappearance it became nec
            essary for Holmes to produce her to
            collect some insurance. Mrs. Quinlan
            consented to act in her place. She
            went to the insurance office and swore
            she was Mrs. Connor, and signed that
            name. According to the statements of
            Jonathan Belmont it was Christmas
            night, four years and six months ago,
            that Mrs. Connor was killed.
            He believes she was asphyxiated in
            her room while she slept. Her room
            was a small one adjoining the dark
            ! bath room in the "castle." When all
            was still in the house Holmes switched
            on the gas. When the deed was ac
            complished Holmes stealthily admitted
            himself through- the secret door of the
            bath room, lifted the inanimate form
            ol Mrs. Connor from the bed, and car
            ried it to the bath room. Then, placing
            the body in the bath tub, he proceeded
            to cut It to pieces, and fed them to a
            hot fire in the stove. When all was
            done he took the ashes and parts of
            the body that had not been entirely
            burned and buried them in lime in the
            cellar. ■_._,.■..
            The police believe the chain of evi
            dence against Pat Quinlan now com
            plete, and Holmes' ex-janitor will be
            tried for murder here.
            A HISSING BROTHER.
            "Horace Williams Disappeared Be
            fore His Sisters Were Rilled.
            CHICAGO, July 27.— William Capps.
            the Fort Worth, Texas, attorney who
            is here in behalf of the heirs of the'
            Williams sisters, advanced a rather
            startling theory today, which if found
            to be true, will add another victim
            to the long list of murders already
            credited to Holmes. According- to
            Capps, Minnie R. Williams ' had a
            brother named Horace A. Williams in j
            Denver, Col. This young man either 1
            was killed or disappeared ' in May .or
            June, ISS3, shortly before the supposed
            murder of the Williams .sisters. The
            manner of his death iSjiiot known to
            the attorney, but he says he has ascer
            tained that the young man was insured '
            for $2,500 in favor of his sister Minnie.
            This fact Mr. Capps considers to be
            decidedly peculiar, as he says it is not
            reasonable to suppose Horace Williams
            would insure his life in favor of a sis
            ter who was already wealthy. He said
            that his Investigations upon this point
            were in an uncompleted state, but
            from what he had learned he was of the
            opinion that Holmes had first insured
            the young man and then been instru
            mental In causing his death.

            Williams Li, es Mediums Interview
            Enieline Cigrscd.
            Chicago, III., Aug. 2. The police have
            at last obtained a partial confession
            from Pat Quinlan, the janitor of the
            Holmes "castle" and have, they be
            lieve, positive evidence that Benjamin
            F. Pietzel was murdered in this city by
            Holmes and the corpse sent to Phila
            delphia. The confession was wormed out of
            Quinlan by means of a tip given the
            local officers by Detective Geyer of
            Philadelphia, who arrived in this city
            today. The exact nature of the story
            told by Quinlan the police will not re
            veal and in fact Chief Badenoch and
            Inspector Fitzpatrick have both denied
            that Quinlan or his wife made any con
            fession at all. Notwithstanding the
            denial of the police, however, it is posi
            tively known that Quinlan made a
            signed confession because it was left
            where Quinlan's signature on the docu
            ment could be seen, although the sub
            ject matter under which he wrote his
            name .could not be ascertained. Tonight
            however, it was learned that a confes
            sion was made covering all the detils
            of the murder of Pietzl with the ex
            ception of the actual place in which
            the crime was committed.
            This the police declare they will have
            tomorrow and they declare that by sun
            set of Aug. 5, they will have undisput
            able evidence that Pietzel came to his
            end through the direct agency of II. II.
            Holmes. The confession was obtained
            from the Quinlans only after the hard
            est kind of work, and at the price of a
            promise of immunity from punishment
            for all the part the Quinlan's may have
            borne in the murder of Pietzel or other
            crimes committed by Holmes.
            MINNIE WILLIAMS LIVES.
            Little Rock, Aug. 2. Attorney O. M.
            Humphreys of Fort Worth arrived here
            today and went almost imemdiately to
            the prison where he and Superintend
            ent McConnell were closeted for some
            time with Convinct Allen. Mr. Hum

            claims against Minnie Wiliam's prop
            erty in Fort Worth on debts contract
            ed by Holmes and his accomplices.
            After the conference he sead:
            "Undoubtedly Allen knows more than
            anybody else about the transfer of the
            Williams property because he spoke to
            me intelligently about the various pa
            pers conected with the deal which are
            now In my possession and the contents
            of which have never been made public.
            I knew Allen in Fort Worth and from
            circumstances as yet unpublished which
            he mentioned to me today, in connec
            tion with those deals. I know he was
            intimate with Holme"."
            "Do you think Minnie Williams is
            still alive?"
            "I most assuredly do. From what I
            know and from what Allen said today,
            I am positive that she is not only liv
            ing but that she is in the United States
            and that were Holmes free he would be
            with her in less than forty-eight hours."
            WHAT MRS. QUINLAN KNOWS.
            Mrs. Pat Quinlan knew of the disap
            pearance of Mrs. Julia L. Conner in
            Holmes' castle and saw the body of
            the woman after she was elead. She
            further knew and has admitted that
            Pearl Conner disappeared mysterious
            ly in the castle after her return from
            a trip to the Quinlan farm at Lake
            Michigan.
            Chief Badenoch took Mrs. Quinlan
            and her husband to the castle today
            with Inspector Fitzpatrick and detec
            tives Fitzpatrick and Norton. The ob
            ject of this trip was more for the pur
            pose of letting Quinlan and his wife
            meet than any other. They were clos
            eted together alone for an hour in the
            room in which the Julia Conner's car
            pet lies and the chair belonging to the
            murdered woman stands. What took
            place between them no one knows but
            Chief Badenoch and his detectives. The
            chief now has proof positive that Mrs.
            Connor and Pearl, her daughter, or Co
            ra Quinlan, were murdered in the main
            building while the mother was in
            Holmes' employe. Quinlan has given
            information within the last twenty-four
            hours which brings the charge of mur
            der nearer to Holmes than it has been
            in Chicago at any time since the case
            opened. Quinlan and his wife while
            demonstrating to the police that they
            were at no time guilty of the crime of
            murder themselves have made admis
            sions by which the chief could use
            them on the stand as valuable witness
            es against Holmes in proving that Mrs.
            Conner anil a child were made away
            with by Holmes for the purpose of se
            curing insurance which Mrs. Cononr
            carried on her life in favor of her
            daughter or in which Cora Quinlan
            cut an important figure.
            Further, Quinlan and his wife have
            proved to the police that Mrs. Con
            nor was so Avell aware of the schemes
            which Holmes were operating that it
            became necessary for Holmes to put
            the woman out of the way.
            Mrs. Connor's bo lv was disposed of
            by burial within tne castle somewhere
            close to tfie spot where Pearl's sup
            posed body was found. The police have
            not ceased their effort" to flnd the bot
            tom of the basement and uncover her
            remains. The digging which was sus
            pended today will continue tomorrow
            and during the coming week. Pat Quin
            Ian and his wife have admitted parti
            ally, the woman more than the man.
            that a business in receiving and dis
            posing of dead bodies stolen from
            country graveyards was carried on in
            the castle under tli direction of
            Holmes. The graveyards of the west
            ern portion of Michigan. Grand Haven
            South Haven. Muskeg.-.n.. Holland. St.
            Joseph. The Bay. Laka. all ancient
            places, with venerable graves were de-sp-Mled
            of bodies.
            The bodies were brought to the cas
            tle, chemically treated ani thn dis
            posed of to medfeal colleges The cof
            fins were re-made by Quinlan. Pietael
            and Holmes, reliaed and disposed of to
            undertakers at a fair profit.
            We have suOlcSent evidence to keep
            Holmes In prion for t he remainder of t
            his natural days" said Detective Geyer
            toiay. "wicnout cnarjnng- nim with

            two Williams girls. M'nnie Williams

            as reported. (
            Richardson corroborates Chappeirs
            story. He fcas told the police all he
            knows oi noimes .ramc in mysterious
            packages ana ooxes ana Debtees the
            express companies receipt? in the Wash

            1S91-93 and where the "packages" he
            handled were delivered.
            The new witness said he did not
            know what these packages contained
            at the time they were handled. To the
            police he made no reservations but
            since Chappell says his traffic was in
            dead men's bones Richardson says he
            is quite prepared to believe it. The num
            ber of these trips to the Wallace street
            house he adds cannot be contained In
            twenty calls, nor thirty.
            "X remember this special package
            very well," said Richardson. "Holmes
            sent these boxes all over the city at
            times to physicians and medical stu
            dents and again to the hospitals direct
            A good part of the stuff was also taken
            to the various depots. He received a
            good many consignments himsplf from
            other points. The boxes handled as I
            remember them were strong and ticht
            C-nd there were also well headed barrels
            in numbers. I don't remember of see
            ing that old trunk Chappell turned up
            r.or do I recall any trips to dump stuff
            in the lake. I guess Holmes had use
            for most everything he handled with
            out throwing anything away."
            MEMPHIS KICKS ON ALLEN.
            Memphis, Tenn., Aug. 2. The Little
            Rock end of the Holmes murder sen
            sation is about petered out. In the next
            forty-eight hours the police will in all
            probability, have proen tha Convict
            John Caldwell could have had no con
            nection with Holmes and his crimes, as
            he was in the Tennessee penitentiary
            for horse stealing at the time he claims
            to have been operating in Fort Worth
            Tex., for Holmes. A few months ago
            he was pordoned but went Immediate
            ly to Arkansas and engnged in his for
            mer pursuit. There he again came to
            grief and was sent to the Arkansas
            state prison where he now is. The
            Memphis police are confident Caldwell's
            story is only a ruse to get out of prison.
            WANTS PAY FOR TALK.
            Minneapolis, Minn., Aug. 2. "Two
            hundred dollars, sir." is the cash value
            placed by C. W. Arnold, the insurance
            agent, on his knowledge of the career
            of Holmes. Nevertheless for the last
            two days Arnold has been a constant at
            tendant at the newspaper offices here
            and has been interviewed to his heart's
            content.
            Arnold was asked point blank today
            as to his holding shares in the com
            panies organized by Holmes for vari
            ous purposes. If you like to pay me
            $200 I will write out what I know and
            hand It to you and the Minneapolis pa
            pers shall publish it at the same time.
            I will dictate it myself to a stenograph
            er, but I tell you before hand I do not
            think it worth a cent to you, as I had
            no knowledge of any crimes. Holmes
            used my name In those companies with
            out my knowledge or authority. In the
            same breath he added: "I never invest
            ed a cent in any of his companies and
            certainly had no knowledge of any of
            his swindling operations. I never went
            up stairs in the house or building. I
            never saw a stenographer or typewriter
            there. There was no handsome blonde
            typewriter there so far as I saw. I
            knew nothing of his vats or furnaces. I
            never sats them. I never saw, met, or
            knew Kmlllne Cigrand, Mrs. Connor,
            or her daughter, Mrs. Lee, Minle Will
            iams or her sister, nor Emily von Tas
            sel. I never insured any of those peo
            ple for Holmes or at Holmes sugges
            tion. All I can say is as to my person
            al dealings with and friendship for Mr.
            Holmes, and I am out for the stuff and
            intend to get it before I say anything.
            Two hundred dollars Is my price. You
            put up the money and I will write you
            a story of a dozen of extraordinary
            facts about Holmes, but I won't talk
            to reporters I am busyv There Is a
            good market for this kind of stuff. Why
            several novelists have already approac
            hed me and offered me large sums to
            tell what I know of Holmes for publi
            cation in book form. I am wanting the
            money and can use it In my business,
            nnd I shall not talk, I tell you, until I
            get it."
            Then Mr. Arnold, who had done most
            of the talking, waited for questions
            with the sang froid of an experienced
            politician. He was atked as to insur
            ances effected by him for Holmes or at
            Holmes' instigation and claimed that
            he insured Holmes by three separate
            policies for $5,000 each, which policies
            Holmes neglected to pay for or take up.
            Arnold admits insuring Pietzel for 2000
            but claims that this policy lapsed and
            long before Pietzel met his end. When
            asked for particulars as to insurance
            companies for whom he worked in Chi
            cago, Arnold denied positively having
            worked for the Mutual Life of Philadel
            phia, the Northwestern or the Vermont
            and in the same breath refused to say
            what companies he worked for.
            When questioned closely as to his
            dealingswith Holmes he claimed that
            his acquaintance was purely a passing
            friendship, though he might have act
            ed as witness to various legal docu
            ments. As to the nature of these he
            essayed to be very mysterious and he
            point blank asked for pecuniary com
            pensation for divulging. He absolute
            ly denies that he was out from 11 p m.
            until 3 a. m. on any occasion attting
            legal documents for Holmes ar. I cut
            short the conversation bv sa ing be
            would talk no more until S200 was forth
            coming for his information.
            SPIRITS ARE INVOKED.
            Anderson, Ind., Aug. 2. The friends
            of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Cigrand, whose
            daughter Emeline is believed to have
            been one of H. H. Holmes' victims, are
            much interested in the attempt by
            spiritualist seances to communicate
            with the spirit of Emeline. A number
            of people have had private sittings with
            mediums, but a they report no satis
            faction a woman whose name must be
            withheld went into a seance for the
            spirit of EmeJine.
            After sitting in a dark room for near
            ly two hours she ays there was a voice
            in the trumpet and she understood it to
            say:
            "This is Emma. I went into the spirit
            land two years ago and was far from
            home. O, it was so horrible." Here the
            words became whispers and were not
            audible. Suddenly another voice said:
            "I hope sister will soon join me. I
            have something awful to tell her. My
            husband is stil beyond the spirit land.
            I send love to mamma and papa, and
            tell the to " and here the spirit stop-
            ped and could not be called again.
            Mrs. Bibbeth Seery. one of the best
            of Indiana mediums, was sen at her
            home in Muncie tonight. Sho would
            not attempt to call up the spirit of
            Emeline Cigrand, for she said it was
            absurd.
            "The laws of aature are the govern
            ment r all mediums and spirit." said
            the medium. "The dead girl would have
            to be well known to any one speaking (
            who saould have talked with the girl
            in worldly life shortly before death. I
            Natural resources are arainst nie. for I
            saould one spirit be called and told to

            circumstances attending her death a
            reported it would affect the spiritual
            condition "
            A trance medium attempted to talk
            with the girl's spirit. He asuaied a
            trance state and speaking for a spirit
            EAld- ,
            "All seems dark; ao Hgnt asywhre: j

              STORY OP THH ARREST.
              Benjamin F. Piterel's liody was round In
              a house at 131C Callow hill street 011 Sep
              tember 3, 1894. A shattered lamp was
              found by the side of -the body wliUh bore
              evidence of having iie-en turned, and the
              coroner's Jury concluded ttiat tlie oil lamp
              had exploded and that Pilczcl, who was
              at the time known as M. F. Perry, had been
              burned to deutti. and accordingly rendered
              a vcntUt or accidental death.
              There was no claimant ror the body and
              it was buried in Potter's field. Subse
              quently an assertion came iroin Mrs. Fltc
              zel's lawyer at St. Louis, Mr. Jeplha
              Uowe, that the body w.u that of Benjamin
              F. Pltezei, and a claim was made ou the
              Fidelity Mutual Life Association of Phil
              adelphia for $10,000, which that cotu
              pauy carries! on Pitezel's life.
              Tlie insurance company paid the claim,
              but not Is'iiig satisfied tti.it Pllc-zel had

              defraud the insurance company. Holmes
              pleaded guilty to Ihjs charge, but to cum
              bat tlie more serious ciiarge of inurdtr
              claimed that Pilczcl is still litiiig: that a

              GKYKU'S DISCOVERIES.
              Holmes was sent to prison to await sen

              Attorney Graham startesl Ilctcctlte Gcyer
              out to v lslt Toronto, Chicago and other
              Western cities, to endeavor to obtain ci
              dence against Holmes which would warrant
              his being arruigucs! for murder.

              District Attorney Graham that Holmes could

              as wltnisssMS against Holmes.
              The approaches to the court room were
              closely guarded, and Hone but jicrsons di
              rectly intcre-sted in the caso.and newspaper
              men, were admitted. The case was called
              shortly after 10 o'clock.
              Holmes walked Jauntily into tlie dock,
              a tipstaff being on cither side of him. He
              was rather pale from long conrincment in
              tlie county prison, but his black beard was
              neatly trimmed, and his black suit of
              clothing gave him adressy appearance.
              Tlie accused took his sent with a calmness
              that was noticeable, and whlleheetlnceda
              decided interest in the matters at issue,
              there was no look of fear upon Ms counto
              nance nor any evidence of nervousness in
              his action.
              SENSATIONAL EPISODE.
              , Judge Arnold overruled the motions for
              postponement in a very few words, and
              ordered the trial to go on. Just at this
              Juncture a startling climax was reached,
              which resulted in the withdrawal of Law
              yers Shoemaker and Rotan from the case,
              notwithstanding an injunction from tho
              court that they would be open to disbar
              ment by taking such a step "ou the eveof a
              murder trial."
              Stili further sensation was created wiien
              Holmes refused to accept the services of
              Attorney! Everett A. Sehofield and Joseph.
              R. Fahy, whom the court was about to ap
              point to -defend him and who, lu fact, had
              taken "scats in the hairs vacated by Messrs.
              Shoemaker and Rotan.
              Sehorieldaud Fahy also withdrew. Holmes
              himself pleaded to the court for a post
              ponement, but the Judge declared that
              tho case must go on. The trial was re
              sumed, Holmes conducting his own defense.

              Toledo, Ohio, Oct. 28. Ever since Sat
              urday night a desperate fire has been raging
              in the coal regions south of here.
              The telegraph and telephone lines arc
              nearly all rendered useless in that Immedi
              ate vicinity, and detailed reports of the
              damage have been difficult to secure.
              The fire seems to have done most damage
              about Merndl, Cygnet and Lucky. Among
              the heaviest losers are the Sun 011 Company,
              nine derricks, four tanks and a boiler
              house, the Palmer Oil Company, twelveder
              rlcks, several tanks and other property;
              the Ohio Oil Company, four derricks and
              other property. Half Brothers, several der
              ricks and buildings.
              The fire startesl on Hie edge of the town
              of Vungen, and burnesl two miles to the
              northeast, a strip nearly a mile wide, de
              stroying everything. This is the heart of
              the best producing oil territory in Ohio.
              The fire is now practically under con
              trol, and while the loss ivlll be very heavy
              from reports at hand, an accurate estimate
              cannot be given. One estimate is $1C0,
              000, others higher.

              The Execution Passed Off Without
              Any Incidents of a Sensa
              tional Nature.
              PHILADELPHIA, Pa., May 7.—Her
              man W. Mudgett, alias H. H. Holmes,
              was hanged this" mornine in the County
              Prison for tne killing of Benjamin F.
              Pietzel.
              The drop fellatlO:l2o'cloctc, and twenty
              minutes later he was pronounced dead by
              the prison officials, Dr. Sharp and Dr.
              Batcher.
              The execntion was in every way entirely
              devoid of any sensational features.
              To the last Holmes was self-possessed
              and cool, even to the extent of giving a
              word of advice to Assistant Superintend
              ent Richardson as the latter -was arrang
              ing the final details. He died as ne had
              lived, unconcerned and thoughtless, ap
              parently, of the future, even with the rec
              ollection still vividly before him of the
              H. H. Holmes, alias Mudgett, the Arch Criminal of Modern History. Who Was
              Hanged Yesterday.
              recent confession in which he admitted
              the killing of a score of persons of both
              sexes in different parts of the country.
              Almost his last words were a point-blank
              denial of any crimes committed except the
              deaths of two women at his hands by mal
              practice.
              Of the murder of several members of tbe
              Pietzel family he denied all complicity,
              particularly of the father, for whose death
              he stated he was unjustly suffering the
              penalty. With the prayer of the spiritual
              attendants still sounding in his ears and
              with a few low-spoken words to those
              about him tbe trap was sprang.
              There were comparatively few persons
              gathered on the outside of the prison dur
              ing the eariy part of the morning and the
              morbid throng which the prison officials
              expected would be drawn there by the
              execution was lacking. Access to the
              prison prior to the entrance of those per
              mitted to witness the execution was not
              allowed.
              All the arrangements for the burial of
              Holmes were entrusted by the murderer
              to Mr. Rotan. The place of interment has,
              it is understood, been selected, but those
              who are most likely to know where the
              grave is to be will not divulge the iov-a
              tion.
              Holmes retired about midnight and
              slept soundly during the entire time until
              called at 6 o'clock this morning. So sound
              were his slumbers, in fact, that twice was
              he called before awauening. When the
              arrival of the Rev. Fathers Dailey and Me-
              Pake to administer the sacrament was an
              nounced he greeted them warmly, but
              witii no show of emotion. For nearly two
              hours they remained in the cell and then
              were succeeded by Lawyer Rotan, the le
              gal adviser of Holmes, who was also
              greeted pleasantly. There were several
              matters pertaining to Holmes' worldly af
              fairs that will yet have to be settled and
              this time was taken in giving the final de
              tails and explanations. While discussing
              his affairs breakfast was served, consisting
              of eggs, toast and coffee.
              When the raeal was ended, shortly be
              fore 9 o'clock, Holmes dressed himself in
              trousers, vest and cutaway coat of some
              dark mixed goods of a pepper and salt ef
              fect he aad worn frequently.
              At 10 o'clocK the doors leading to the
              long corridor in which was placed the
              gallows were opened and, two by two, led
              by the Sheriff's jury, the spectators
              passea down. The last man had just
              passed through the doors and the latter
              closed when from behind was heard the
              slow and measured tread of the death
              party.
              The suspense was almost painful, brief
              though it was, when, preceded by Sheriff
              Clements and Superintendent Perkins,
              Holmes appeared and stepped on the trap.
              On the right was Father Dailey, to the
              left Fat; er McPake, and behind them
              Lawyer Rotan and Assistant Superin
              tendent Richardson. The little party
              stood a moment looking down, and then,
              in response to a signal from one of those
              beside him, Holmes stepped forward. He
              spoke slowly and with measured attention
              to every word— a trifle low at first, but
              louder as he proceeded, until every woid
              was distinctly audible.
              "Gentlemen," he said, "I have very few
              words to say, in fact, I would make no
              statemeut at this time, except that by not
              speaking I may be made to acquiesce in
              my execution. I only want to say that
              the extent of my wrongdoings in the
              taking of human life consisted in the
              death of two women, they having died at

              there will be no misunderstanding here
              after, tnat I am not guilty of taking the
              lives of any of the Pietzel family, the three
              children or the father, Benjamin F. Piet
              zel, of whose death I am now convicted,
              and for which I am to-day to be hanged.
              That is all."
              As he ceased speaking he stepped back,
              and kneeling between Fathers Dailey and
              McPake, he joined with them in silent
              prayer for a minute or two. Again stand
              ing he sbook hands with all about him
              and then signified his readiness for the
              end. Holmes was the coolest of the wuole
              yiarty. He even went to the extreme of
              suggesting to Assistant Superintendent
              Richardson that the latter should not
              hurry himself.
              "Take your time; don't bungle it,"
              Holmes remarked as the official exhibited
              some little haste, the outcome of nervous
              ness. These were almost his last words.
              The cap was adjusted, a low-toned query,
              "Are you ready?" and an equally low
              toned response, "Yes, good-by," and the
              trap was sprung.
              Holmes' neck was not broken, and there
              were a few convulsive twitches of the
              limbs that continued for about ten min
              utes. "But he suffered none after the
              drop," said Dr. Scott, the prison physi
              cian.
              The trap was sprung precisely at ]0:12)£,
              and fifteen minutes later Holmes was pro
              nounced dead, though the body was not
              cut down until 10:45. When ii was laid
              out on the stretcher occurred the only in
              cident approaching the revolting in con
              nection with the affair.
              The knot bad become jammed and the
              efforts of the doctors failed to loosen it as
              they attempted to remove the noose from
              about the neck. The head was twisted
              about from side to side in the attempt, and
              finally it was decided to cut the rope.
              Superintendent Perkins objected, however,
              and the knot was undone after several
              minutes of trying work.
              After the body had been viewed by the
              physicians and the manner of death dt
              termined the stretcher on whicn it lay was
              wheeled out of the corridor into the jail
              yard. Hero it was placed in an ordinary
              cheap pine coffin, wide enough and deep
              enough to have held two men of Holmes'
              size. The coffin was put aboard an under
              taker's wagon and conveyed to the Roman
              Catholic Cemetery of the Holy Cross.
              The only persons at the cemetery were
              the undertaker and his assistant, two
              grave-diggers, two watchmen and a couple
              of newspaper men. The little company
              acted as pallbearers, and carried the coffin
              to the receiving vault. The last act in tne
              receiving vault was performed at Holmes'
              express command.
              The lid of the coffin was taken off and
              the body was lifted out and laid on the
              ground. Then the bottom of tbe coffin
              was filled with cement. The body was
              then replaced in the coffin and covered
              with cement. It was Holmes' idea that
              this cement would harden around his
              body and prevent any attempt at grave
              robbery. The coffin was left in the receiv
              ing vault under the guard of two watch
              men, who will remain on duty all night.
              To-morrow afternoon the body will be in
              terred in a grave in the cemetery, and it is
              probable that at the time religious serv
              ices will be conducted by Father Dailey.
              Holmes made no will and left no con
              fession. This is according to Mr. Rotan.
              He says he knows Holmes made no will,
              and, while the murderer gave him this
              mornine a big bundle of papers, the law
              yer says that he is confident that these
              papers relate only to private business
              matters. A3 yet Mr. Rotan has had no
              opportunity to examine them.
              Mrs, Pietzel was seen after Holmes was
              hanged. All she could say, between her
              sobs, was that she was glad that he had
              received her just deserts, but that his
              death would not return to her her hus
              band or her children. Mrs. Pietzel will
              return to her home, at Galva, 111., next
              week.
              The two women referred to by Holmes
              in nis confession from the scaffold were
              Julia Connor of Chicago and Emily
              Cigrand of Anderson, Ind.
              HOLMES' MANY CRIMES.
              He Had a Ready "Confession" to Clear
              Himself of Ench.
              Herman W. Mudgett, better known as
              H. H. Holmes, was one of the most con
              spicuous criminals of modern times, and
              If the "murder confessions" which he has
              written can only partially be believed, he
              was without a peer as a bloodthirsty
              demon. His recent ingenious "confes
              sion," wherein he claimed to have killed
              twenty-seven persons, was disproved,
              partly, at least, by the appearance of sev
              eral of the so-called victims: but Holmes'
              object in making the "confession" was re
              alized — the obtaining of a sum said to be
              $7500 and which amount is said to have
              been settled upon the criminal's 18-year
              old son. While the "confessions" have
              served to increase the sensationalism of
              the case, the only capital crime for which
              Holmes had to answer was the killing in
              this city on September 2, 1884, of Benja
              min F. Pietzel, bis fellow-conspirator.
              The murder was committed in the dwell
              ing, 1316 Callowhill street. Holmes' con
              viction of murder in the first degree, the
              affirmation by the Pennsylvania Supreme
              Court of the verdict and the recent re
              fusal of Governor Hastings to grant a re
              spite, are so well known that a narration
              oJ these facts is unnecessary.
              Holmes was captured in Boston, Mass.,
              in the latter part of 1894 by Owen Hans
              com. the Deputy Superintendent of
              upon the strength of a telegram from Fort

            Before his death he told physicians
            ho had taken poison.
            Quinlan was a carpenter and was
            employed by Dr. J. J. Holmes to
            build the structure. The police held
            him for a time as a possible accom
            plice. Trap-doors, false partitions and
            numbers of wires were part of the
            equipment found'ln the "Castle".
            "He couldn't sleep" was the reason

              for tho burning of a human body.
              A person could be thrown into the
              stove bodily and could be burned to
              nothing.

              FINDING OF BODY
              STARTS SEARCH.
              The finding of the body of a vic
              tim always starts the search for the
              slayer. If a man could dispose of
              tho body he could slay on a whole
              sale plan and avoid detection.
              Holmes is believed to have built the
              castle with a view of hiding bodies
              of those he slew. He directed the
              work on the building. Qulnlan was
              only an ordinary workman who did
              what he was told unhesitatingly.
              Qulnlan never questioned the au
              thority of the slayer. He never
              asked who the women were Holmes
              had visiting him. He never asked
              where they went when they disap
              peared. He was an ideal servant.
              Born in a small Michigan commun
              ity he went to Chicago to make his
              fortune. Chicago was about to have
              a world's fair in commemoration of
              the. discovery of America.
              It was a good town to go to,
              thought Quinlan. An honest Irish
              young man, hla only thought of mak
              ing a living was by honest hard
              work. That Is why he went to work
              for Holmes and worked so wllllng
              ly and so faithfully. The other day
              w hen he drank the fatal potion he
              was middle-aged and broken in
              health. He looked as though he had
              been carried to the point of death
              by tho ghosts of the slain women of
              the castlo ho helped to build.
              It is said by some of his best
              friends that he often reproarhed
              himself for his part In the affair.
              Ho blamed himself for not suspect
              ing Holmes and turning him up to
              the police. Yet he could not bo
              blamed. Every thing in Holmes Cas
              tle seemed to be right. There was
              no sign of murder there. Every
              thing was quiet and still. The rooms
              were lined with asbestos and the
              dying victims never made a sound
              that reached the outsldo world.
              There at night In tho dark house
              they met their death.
              Some of them wero asphyxiated.
              It la believed. Others wore stabbed.

              Others were shot, according to the
              opinions of investigator. No one
              knows. Holmes knew and the vic
              tims perhaps could tell harrowing
              tales if they could talk, but theyr are
              gone and Holmes has been hung for
              his crimes, so In this world no one
              ever will know.
              How many crimes Holmes devised
              no one can tell. Tho first thing to
              attract the attention of tho world
              was the sudden, horrible death of
              B. F. PSetzel. a ihemlst. in Phila

              the body.
              It is alleged that Holmes met Mrs.
              Pletzel and informed her the body
              was not that of her husband but
              that her husband had his life in

              half to him."
              Mrs Pletzel later confessed that
              she Identifcd the body without be
              lieving it was that of her husband.
              She thought it was a big swindle
              game on the part of her husband
              and she entered into it readily She
              brought her three children. Alice,
              Nellie and Howard with her. Alice
              was 15 years old. Holmes sepa
              rated her from her children and
              took them to Toronto, Canada,
              Later the bodies, of Alice and
              Nellie were found In the cellar of a
              building Holmes had occupied at
              Toronto.

              Marian Hedgepeth is the man who
              drat directed attention to Holmes.
              Holmes was conducting a drug atoro
              In St Louis when he was arrested on
              a minor charge and placed In jail.
              There ho met Marion Hedgepeth,
              noted as an out and out criminal.
              Holmes asked Hcdgepeth to tell him
              the name of some St, Louis lawyer
              who could give him assistance In
              putting over an Insurance swindle.

              Hedgepeth said he gave him the
              name. In return Hedgepeth was to
              get $500. The swindle was con
              summated. That is Pletzel was
              killed in Philadelphia in order to col
              let the Insurance, but Hedgepeth got
              no money.
              Then Hedgepeth notified Chief of
              Police Harrlgan of St. Louis that he
              had "the biggest insurance swindle
              case the police ever had to deal
              with anywhere, anytime in the
              world'
              He sent that message to Harrlgan
              October 9. 1894. Pietzel had died
              September 3. 1894. That failure to
              deal squarely with Hedgepeth is
              doubtless what cost Holmes his
              liberty and life and checked his
              long career of crime. Police at
              once set out to hunt for him. The
              Philadelphia death of Pietzel had
              caused them some wonder, but tho
              word from Hedgepeth made them
              doubly cure of crime. They trailed
              Holmes to Toronto, where the
              bodies of Alice and Nellie Pletzel
              were found. Later they found the
              body of Howard In Indianapolis and
              Identified it as that of Howard, be
              cause of some peculiar playthings
              he had. His body had been burned
              In a stove and the bones alone were
              left Intact.
              Holmes was found In Boston and
              arrested. He was going under tho
              name of Howard there. He was ar
              rested July 14. 1895.
              Mrs. Pletzel told her part in the
              afflr and tried to atone by fisht
              lng for the conviction of the man
              who had made her a widow and
              had slain three of her beautiful
              children.
              In Chicago the record of Holmes
              was looked up. When he was un
              der arrest in Philadelphia awaiting
              trial for the death of Pletzel word
              .ame from all parts of tho United
              Slates that Holmes, or a man an
              swering his description, had taken
              women from their town and the
              unfortunates had never been heard
              from
              From Fort Worth came the In
              formation that Miss Minnie Wil
              liams and her sister, Anna, had
              been led away by Holmes several
              years before and no one had ever
              heard of them. It was found that
              Miss Minnie Williams had entered
              Holmes castlo under the supposi
              tion that she was to be the wife of
              the arch-slayer. She sent to Fort
              Worth for her sister. Anna, to be
              a bridesmaid at the w:diing.
              The sisters had JG0.000 worth
              of property In Forth Worth. They
              were induced to borrow heavily on
              the property and that Is the last
              anyone heard of them. Minnie, the
              bride-elect, died before the wedding
              In Holmes Castle Anna, the brides-mald-to-be.
              also died without ever
              having a chance to wear her bridal
              clothes What happened to tho
              bodies no one knows for certain.
              In the fine of the chimney, whlh
              led from the big stove on the top
              floor, hair was found. It Is believed
              that the hair was that of the sisters
              as It corresponded to their hair The
              theory was advanced at the time
              that the sisters were thrown Into the
              stove and burned. The suction of
              the flue carried the hair up In the
              flue, where it remained as mute evi
              dence against Holmes.
              From Davenport, Io., came an
              other story of disappearance and
              Holmes name was linked with that
              too. Mrs.v Julia Connor and her
              daughter were the missing ones.
              BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
              AND DAUGHTER LOST.
              For more than three years prior
              to 1 895, Mrs. Julia 1 Connor and
              her daughter, Pearl, had been mlss-
              ing from their friends in Iowa.
              Mrs. Connor had gone to Chicago
              v.ith her husband and daughter to
              work in a drug store conducted by
              Holmes. The drug store failed and
              Holmes gave the property to Con
              nor. Mrs. Connor was so taken with
              his generosity that she ceased to
              love her husband. She returned to
              Davenport and Connor obtained a
              divorce.
              Then she returned to Chicago, os
              tensibly to open a boarding house
              in Chicago or the suburbs. She and
              hor daughter never were heard of
              again. When Holmes was arrested
              in Philadelphia, relatives of Julia
              Connor claimed he killed her.
              Many bones wero found around
              Holmes Castle. He explained they
              were beef bones. He explained that
              the flat had been used as a restau
              rant during the World's Fair at Chi
              cago and that much meat was used
              there. He explained that the huge
              dumb waiter was used to convey
              food. He explained that the as
              bestos was to make the house fire
              proof and to keep out cold.
              He had an excuse for everything.
              He admitted he was crooked. He
              explained that he went to Toronto
              to smuggle furs into the United 111?!
              States. He admitted knowing alt
              the women ho was accused of mur-
              dering He admitted knowing Piet- Ewg
              zel. He denied killing any of them. H&l
              Damaging evidence against him Bb
              were buttons of the women he was KhI
              charged with killing, which were
              found in his castle. bIH
              But the defense of Holmes netted LH
              him nothing. He swung from the hI
              gallows for his crimes.
              Though Holmes paid for his mis- jlfl
              deeds with death, Qulnlan suffered Bl
              much more than he. He was ar- LH
              rested with Holmes but freed.
              When he went back to his Mlchl- W

            THERE was no sudden flash of lightning,
            no sound of demoniac trumpets, no sul
            len roll of thunder to announce to the
            world that a dark prince was horn when, on
            the 16th of May in 1660. a country doctor at
            Gilmanton, New Hampshire, wrote into the
            birth records the name of Herman Mudgett.
            In school young Mudgett was remembered
            for a certain precocity; a deft hand and lumi
            nous black eyes. At sixteen he, himself, was
            schoolmaster, and two years later, considered
            the "catch” of the region, he courted, won and
            married the "local belle”—Clara Lovering
            Her family had money and in 1679 her
            father, impressed with Herman's mental abil
            ity. willingly sent the young couple to Ann
            Arbor, where Mudgett wished to study medi
            cine at the University of Michigan.
            If he played practical jokes in the dissect,
            ting room and unmercifully hazed other Fresh
            men with "spare parts” and. skeletons, it was
            put down as the exut* ntiee and
            enthusiasm of a budding genius
            Rut in his Sophomore year Mudgett
            hatched a high-jinx that no amount i
            of toleration could regard as a prank A
            A fellow student was insured for
            $1 000 with Mudgett the beneficiary
            Then a cadaver was stolen from the Wj
            medical school and planted as the
            dead body of the insured.
            Mudgett had the supf*>sed body of

            In a young
            man calling him
            self H H Holmes
            opened a pharmacy
            in midtown Phila
            delphia. He had

            women His drug

            a I>r H H Holmes,
            1 um i noil s - e y e d.
            soft-spoken and ob-
            viously well off. who purchased a three-story
            corner building on 63rd Street, a substantial
            property with stores on the ground fl«»or.
            apartments upstairs, overhanging bastion
            upper windows and a corner apothecary shop.
            It had a vaguely sinister look, even before
            the impressive-looking doctor bought it
            Dr. Holmes reserved the upper floors of
            this castle for himself. The drugstore he
            rented to I L. Connor, who had a pretty wife
            and an infant daughter, Gertrude. Mr. and
            Mrs Connor especially Mrs Connor- thought
            Dr. Holmes a charming landlord.
            He spent a lot of energy installing modern
            plumbing, putting down floors, tearing out
            walls, constructing a third-floor laboratory.
            Much of this work he did himself and
            (somewhat to buxom Mrs. Connor’s envy)
            included among the installations a blond sei -
            retary. Miss Emily Cigrand.
            During the next~four years a prosperous
            Herman Holmes operated a chain of small
            drugstores through the Middle West.
            Tn St. Louis kindly Dr. Holmes became
            interested in a shabby drug clerk named Ben
            jamin Pitezel who had four small children
            and an ailing (but pretty) wife.
            Generously the doctor put Pitezel in charge
            of his St. Louis stores while he commuted
            between St. Louis and Chicago.
            Some time during this period of expansion
            the good doctor raised a glossy, blue-black
            beard. Too, on one of his returns to Chicago
            he told Mrs. Connor that Miss Cigrand had
            left, and ho was seeking a new secretary.
            So. presently, there was a new face in tho
            home office on 63rd Street--that of Minnie
            Williams, a pretty Texas girl.
            In a chain of letters to her sister Nettie,
            in Fort Worth, she confessed that she was
            falling in love. In 1893 Minnie invited Nettie
            to Chicago. Dr. Holmes, it appeared, wouldn’t
            think of leading her to the altar unless her
            rister were on hand to witness the ceremony.
            Nettie journeyed to Chicago forthwith The
            \ . edding was quiet hut beautiful. Dr. Holmes

            made such a thoughtful

            So thought Mrs. Con
            nor one day when she was
            downstairs alone and the
            doctor strolled in to col
            lect the rent.
            ”1 haven’t seen Minnie
            and Nettie all week Are
            they away?" she asked.
            The doctor nodded, pet

            "They’ve gone on a long

            Tn 1894 a Philadelphia paper carried an
            account of a ''mysterious chemical explosion ”
            An amateur inventor calling at the office
            of “B. t\ Perry Patents Bought and Sold’’
            in a dingy building on Callow hill Street was
            shocked to find the pa**nt attorney dead on
            the* floor, his features burned beyond recog
            nition and the room strewn with charred
            papers, broken glass and other wret kage
            The inventor rushed for the police
            The bluecoats decided Perry had been killed
            during an experiment with some sort of «x
            --plosive. Then, searching his effects they
            could find no business papers, no means of
            identification other than the name on his door.
            Detectives Frank Geyer and Thomas Craw*
            ford, assigned to the case, found other mys
            teries. Although the face was destroyed as
            though by volatile and or chemic al, the body
            lay in an attitude of composure.
            Among shattered test tubes and parapher
            nalia. they found the victim's pmc neatly
            loaded with tobacco. A box of matches had
            not been ignited by tho blast
            “Funny nolmdy in the neighborhood heard
            it,” Geyer remarked
            And on top of that, the pest mm em it-

            vealed chloroform in the victim’s stomach.
            Geyer and Crawford were suspicious, but
            the coroner’s verdict was “death- induced by
            explosion, probably suicide."
            One Week after the burial in potter
            field, the authorities received a letter from a
            Chicago lawyer. Jeptha Howe, asserting that
            I’errv was tho professional name of Benjamin
            F. Pitezel, an experimental chemist that a
            SIO,OOO insurance award whs due his widow
            who would presently arrive in Philadelphia to
            identify her husband's remains.
            In a few* days the tardy claimants arrived.
            Mrs Carrie Pitezel. described as ill, was r.< f
            in the party, which included Lawyer How* .
            little Alice Pitezel. and a “friend of the
            family." a Dr. H. H. Holmes.
            In tears, fourteen-year-old Alice had diffi
            culty recognizing the disinterred corpse, but
            friend Holmes spoke up quietly. “If it’s poor
            Pitezel. he’ll have a mole on his left shoulder
            blade!”
            The identifying mole was found.
            Just as Lawyer Howe. Alice and H\l: *s
            were leaving the morgue, the amateur inven
            tor who had discovered the body happened in
            and gazed suspiciously after Holmes.

            As always. Holmes was generous. He told
            Mrs. Pitezel to travel on this money to Bur
            lington. Vermont, with her youngest child and
            new baby. He would keep Alice, Nellie and
            Howard, the oldest children, in his rare until
            Mrs. Pitezel could rjiove into a house he owned
            in Burlington. Mrs. Pitezel obeyed
            Poor Alice, Nellie and toddling Howard set
            out for what he called his "castle in Chicago."
            This was in October, 1894.
            Mrs. I, L Connor. Incidentally, who had
            separated from her husband to become the
            doctor’s secretary, was no longer at the Chi
            cago address. Neither was her little daughter.
            Meanwhile Detectives Geyer and Crawford
            had received a startling communication from
            Mrs Pitezel in Vermont and summoned h* r to
            Philadelphia immediately.
            Mrs. Pitezel told them an appalling
            story. Holmes was a master swindler, she
            asserted! Substituting medical cadavers for
            insured accomplices, he’d made a fortune on
            fraudulent death claims. He had Induced
            her husband to take part in such a fraud, but
            she was afraid no substitution had been made!,'
            "He keeps writing to me that Ben is in
            hiding But his 1« tters are evasive. I know
            he murdered 'ihn! And Uc w *x)t my three
            fatal explosion.”
            , The detectives
            didn’t like the smell
            of it Against their
            private advice, how
            ever. the life insur
            ance company mailed
            a check for SIO,OOO
            to widowed Carrie
            Pitezel.
            Dr Holmes had
            an.irved to meet
            Mrs. Pitezel in St.
            Ivtniis where the check
            was cashed and
            $2 800 paid to Law
            yer Howe. Then, in
            a confidential talk
            with Mrs. Pitezel,
            Holmes revealed an
            unpaid debt of $7,000
            against her husband.
            He advised Mrs. Pite
            z« 1 to let him handle
            this, and she gave
            oldest children with him in Chicago 1”
            Geyer and Crawford were inclined to share
            Mrs. Pitezel’* fears as they set out to locate
            Dr. Holmes and the children. The trail was
            a snake-track, but by dogged persistence, aided
            by the postal authorities, they traced his
            career from Mudgett to medical king with
            the gloomy ’’castle’’ in Chicago.
            On the way they found little Howard in a
            house in Indianapolis, his tiny body stuffed up
            a fireplace chimney.
            They learned Holmes owned the house, but
            if was not until they broke into the Chicago
            < ,i*tle that they knew they were dealing with
            the century’s worst mass murderer.
            There they found a sound-proofed chamber,
            surgical tools and torture instruments.
            A trap door in the hathroom led down to a
            secret oubliette in the cellar. There, in a
            furnace and under the floor, they found the
            bones and charred remnants of the Williams
            sisters, Mrs. Connor, children, wives and sec
            retaries. There was evidence to indicate he
            had sold Miss Cigrand s skeleton to a medical
            academy!
            It was not difficult to picture the suave
            Holmes ushering his victim* gallantly down
            the stairs to have them pause, transfixed, as
            many things became clear to them in one re
            vealing instant.
            The detectives redoubled their effort.
            Holmes, they learned, had departed for
            Vermont. And there they arrested the livid
            man; he had gone Fast to wipe out the re
            mainder of the Pitezel family!
            No one knows or will ever know the total
            of his killings. Taken to Philadelphia, he con
            fessed to two murders a year over a period of
            approximately fourteen years.
            Blubbering in his beard, he went to the
            Moyamensing Prison gallows on May 7. 1895
            Then, lethal to the eyes blazing, he pro
            nounced a curse on all the persons who had
            contributed to hia downfall.
            Within a year the prison warden, the
            coroner, the undertaker who embalmed him,
            and the Jury foreman were dead, l ie follow
            ing year the hangman fell dead, another
            juryman committed suicide, and the prie.
            who heard his confession was found dead ir an
            alley with a fractured skull. And in 1912 De
            tective Crawford, laughing at a joke about
            Holmes, himself fell dead
            ’ Up until Hitler, historians considered the
            Roman Emperor, Caligula, the foulest man
            of all time They overlooked Herman Mudgett.

        <text>LONG LOST MYSTERY SOLVED IN
          FINDING OF BONES?
          The police believe that a mystery
          of 20 years' standing was solved
          when Wm. Raelz, plowing his farm
          near Momence, HI., uncovered the
          bodies of two men and a girl.
          The girl is thought to have been
          Minnie Williams, third bigamous wife
          of Herman Webster Mudgett, alias H.
          H. Holmes, slayer of twelve.
          She disappeared while living in the
          "castle" of Holmes at 61st and Wal
          lace sts. After Holmes' death on a
          Philadelphia scaffold a. search for her
          was begun, but her body was not
          found.</text>

            THE MOON LADY.
            Illustration by Ethel Reed from Mrs. Blodgett's "Fairy Tales." Copyright, 1896 by
            Lamson, Wolfe & Co.
            the non-heredity of acquired charac
            teristics, becomes by virtue of his own
            account of himself and of Dr. Tille's
            lucid introduction of his works, one of
            the most curious and interesting fig
            ures in modern thought.
            The thing for which Nietzsche really
            stands is the application of a physio
            logical rather than a psychological
            test to man and civilization. U.ntil re
            cently scientists have practically con
            ceded that the evolution of man as
            it goes on at present is not a contin
            uous process with his evolution in the
            past. In the animal world without
            man "higher" means with more phys
            ical strength, more differentiated,
            more prolific, more able to cope with
            natural enemies. If the word "higher"
            were used of man in the same way,
            the savage would be a higher type
            than the civilized man. As applied to
            man "higher" implies social depen
            dence, mildness and mentality. Dar
            win, Wallace, Spencer, Huxley, have
            all practically concurred in the view
            stated by Prof. Fiske in "the Destiny
            of Man" when he says, "When human
            ity began to be evolved an entirely
            new chapter in the history of the uni
            verse was opened. Henceforth the life
            of the nascent soul came to be first
            In importance, and the bodily life be
            came subordinated to it. Henceforth
            it appeared that the process of zoolog
            ical change had come to an end, and
            the process of psychological change
            was to take its place "
            It is only in the last few years that
            certain thinkers have perceived ,the
            duality of standard imposed upon the
            process of evolution by this conces
            sion to that development of man
            which Is not physical, and have fret
            ted themselves concerning it, propos
            ing at last, with sublime audacity, to
            unify the evolutionary process 'by
            throwing overboard as valueless all
            the results of evolution in the last few
            thousand years, since, in short, psy
            chological differentiation began to be
            of importance. Their idea is to meas
            ure man. his civilization, his art, but
            above all his religton, by their effect
            on his species, by the standard of
            physiology.
            Nietzsche is the foremost representa
            tive of this school of thought In Eu
            rope. He was professor at Bale until
            he went insane in 1889, and it is impos
            sible not to infer that his philosophy
            is merely the result of a life of disease,
            the sufferer's method of flinging his
            gauntlet in the face of destiny.
            An aristocrat, a philosopher, a poet, a
            brilliant and disdainful thinker, the
            first volume of his works as trans
            lated was the last to be written by
            him, and the trail of his disease will
            be everywhere visible in it to those
            conversant with mental maladies.
            "The Case of Wagrner" Is a disjointed,
            epigrammatic, inconsistent arraign
            ment of the great musician which is
            well worth reading, but which con
            vinces the reader chiefly of the author's
            incoherence. "-.-^Klt,.
            He vituperates through 'JJJjSGrS&ZQs
            of unproved assertions to-^jjJPeffect
            that Wagner is a decadent;^ h£, is al
            ways "saving- somebody^'-W'd&wbcates
            holiness— ''Holiness, the*' Idst Unjf the
            higher values, perhaps still s&n? by the
            populace and woman, the horizon of
            the ideal for all who are naturally my
            opic For philosophers, however, It is
            like every other horizon, a mere mis
            apprehension, a sort of door-closing of
            the region where their world only com
            mences." Wagner, he claims, ruins the
            health of those who listen to him. The
            proof lies in the fact that he himself
            does not breathe easily when listening
            to Wagner, and is not exhilerated as
            he is by dance music, or the operas
            of Bizet. He confesses that when he
            was younger he regarded Wagner's
            music as the expression of a powerful
            superabundance of nature. In the
            same way he regarded the philosophi
            cal pessimist of the nineteenth cen
            tury as the symptom of a "triumphal
            fulness of life." "I took tragical per
            ception for the choicest luxury of our
            civilization, as its most precious, most
            noble, most dangerous mode of squan
            dering, but always.on the ground of its
            superabundance, as its permitted lux
            ury." In other words, in the days of
            his own strength and vigor he per
            ceived what was really true, that it is
            only the great productive eras, the as
            cending eras of history, in which
            freaks abound. Pessimism is one of
            the direct products of vitality. But,
            as he grew older, become broken in
            health, jaded, fatigued, and began to
            decline toward madness, the things
            which had previously seemed to him
            symptoms of health and vigor began
            to seem marks of impoverishment and
            decay, and he conceived the splendidly
            insolent idea of arraigning human civ
            ilization in the stead of himself, and
            accusing religion of all the evils which
            are especially attendant on the lack
            of it. Few men have ever planned or
            carried out so brilliant and so hopeless
            a campaign, but in the valley of hu
            miliation to which he has gone down
            intellectually, there can enter no
            thought of satisfaction at his unique
            revenge upon the world.
            If it were worth while to arraign his
            inconsistencies, it wouKl be interesting
            to note what he says of Bizet's music
            in the light of the fact that his tests of
            art are supposed to be physical and
            not psychical. He finds that melody
            makes the spirit free, that it gives
            wings to thought, and makes of the
            philosopher a better philosopher." The
            grey heaven of obstruction thrilled as
            it were, by lightnings; the light strong
            enough for all the filigree of things;
            the great problems ready to be
            grasped; the universe surveyed as from
            a mountain summit. Answers fall into
            my lap unexpectedly; a little hail
            shower of ice and wisdom, of solved
            problems, Bizet makes me productive.
            All that is good makes me productive.
            I have no other gratitude, nor have I
            any other proof of what is good."— ln
            other words, the amount of intellectual
            stimulus a thing affords is the supreme
            test of its value — a contention which
            wculd come more gracefully from one
            who conceived of psychological evolu
            tion as the matter of chief importance.
            Besides his arraignment of Wagner the
            volume under consideration contains
            "The Twilight of the Idols," a number
            of iconoclastic papers and paragraphs
            in which the author of Soc
            rates and all the '"'great wise men" as
            "declining types/ scoffs at "Reason in
            Philosophy;" arraigns Christian mor
            ality as r.nti-natural; finds the German
            nation unworthy of consideration; set
            tles Renan, Seint Beuve, the Imitatio
            Christi, George Eliot, George Sand, Car
            lyle, Emerson, Spencer, and the labor
            question in a paragraph apiece.
            The Jast essay in the book is entitled
            "The Anti Christ; an essay towards a
            criticism of Christianity," and is a very
            curious piece of literature. The author
            posits a "real" world which is apparent
            ly a material one, though he is by no
            means a consistent materialist. Every
            thing which differs from this "real"
            world of his is not only false but cor
            rupt. Nietzsche alone possesses the
            touch-stone of reality. "Pure spirit is
            pure lie." "In Christianity neither
            morality nor .religion is in contact with
            any point of actuality." "Christianity,
            a form of mortal hostility to reality
            which has not hitherto been sur
            passed." God is a decadent, Christ is
            a symbolist, screams this strange phil
            osopher who is singularly unphiloso
            phic, who uses the language of Billings
            gate, and regards invective as argu
            ment. "I am" from Jehovah is base
            imposition. "I am" from Nietzsche is
            proper self-assertion, is the upshot of
            some hundred pages of raving. Chris
            tianity is antimatural in that it would
            take the world from the strong and
            give it to the weak. The world was
            meant for the few, of whom the writer
            is chief. Sympathy is a mortally dan
            gerous disease. To be sound is to be
            pitiless. To be pitiless is to be noble.
            The fact that the consensus of human
            opinion is on the other side is only one
            argument the more in the mind of
            this man for his own point of view, for
            the vulgar are habitually in error and
            to be against them is almost a proof
            THE SaINT PAUL GLOBE: SUNDAT, ytTLt 19, 18901
            of right-thinking. The Christian
            values are false because they are false
            to him; and because they are false to
            him, "Christianity Js the one immortal
            blemish of mankind."
            All this is very interesting, but it 1b
            not philosophy. That a man bo evi
            dently Buffering from the sense of ex
            aggregated self-importance which is
            preliminary to paresis should b« re
            garded as a "European event" and
            should give rise to an Independent
            school of thought upon the continent
            is somewhat incredible and could hard
            ly occur in an age less avid of some
            new thing than our own. Hlb neces
            sarily limited vogue is the only excuse
            for taking him seriously, and it is not
            on the whole a valid excuse. Wher
            ever the future of philosophy lies, it is
            not In the hands of this man. At a
            venture one might guess that he who
            shall show that even as evolution
            ceased to be physical and became
            psychological, so it also has ceased to
            be psjichelo^ical and become spiri
            tual Is the coming philosopher.
            His task will be less impossible than
            that of those who would overthrow all
            that evolution has accomplished with
            the race in the last few thousand years.

                  <text>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, the German philos
          opher, the announcement of whose death on Satur
          day at Weimar was printed in yesterday's Tribune,
          was born In Saxony on October 15, 1844. He was
          said to be precocious as a child, having on one
          occasion deliberately burned his hand to show that
          Muclus Seaevoik's similar act was but a trifling
          matter. As a schoolboy he became acquainted with
          Wagner's music, which had a great influence on
          his after life. He studied at Bonn and Lelpsic
          universities, and at his graduation was considered
          a man of extraordinary breadth of knowledge.
          Although educated for the ministry, he soon re
          nounced it. and at twenty-six years of age he was
          appointed professor of philology at Basle, making
          a specialty of Oriental languages. While there he
          became Intimately acquainted with Wagner. In
          1876, however, while he was attending the Bayreuth
          performances, an entire change came over his
          views, and he became a violent opponent of Wag
          ner. From this is thought by many to date the
          beginning of the mental malady that wrecked the
          last years of his life. In 1S&0 he was obliged to
          resign his professorship at Basle, and for nine
          years thereafter he visited various health resorts
          in Europe, trying to ward oft the insanity that
          hung over him. Meanwhile, his literary activity
          was incessant, accompanied by an ever increasing
          egotism that made him say of his book. "Thus
          Spake Zarathustra." "I have given to men the
          deepest book they possess."
          In li&s he became hopelessly insane, and in this
          condition he continued till his death or. Saturday.
          His works expound a revolutionary philosophy, de
          nouncing all religion, advocating socialistic ideas
          and treating all moral laws as remnants of Chris
          tian superstition. His Ideal was unbridled free
          dom in the struggle for existence, seeking pleasure
          only and despising pity. He wad strongly influ
          enced by Schopenhauer. A translation of his
          works into English has been undertakes. His
          book. "The Case of Wagner" (ISSS). is a violent
          attack on Wagner's music dramas and theories of
          the lyric drama, combating them as warm. as he

          Judge John W. Crane, one of the most prominent

              time:
              Wagner is all that we had hoped of him: a
              great md lavish mind. an enonretio mtnd, and
              an entraneingly amiable man.
              1 have found a man who, as no other. reveals
              to me the likeness of what Schopenhauer calls
              "the genina." This is no other than Richard
              u agner, about whom you must believe no Judg
              menl that appears in the press, the writmgs of
              muslcal ptdants. etc. No one knows him, no one
              cHn judge him, for all the world stands on an
              >:h. r foundation and is not native to his atmoa
              phere. In him there reigns so unconditional an
              ideality, so deep and touching a humanity. so
              subHme an earnestness of life, that near him I
              feel myself in neighborhood of the divine.

              have been a quarrel over Brahms. At any r

          "Man is a bridge and a goal." he says
          in one place: and, again. "Man is a
          transit and an exit." What Nietzsche
          aimeil at doing was to get rid of the
          idea of an absolute good anil evil and
          to substitute an Immediate sense of
          good and bad. pleasant and unpleasant,
          worth while or unworthy. The essence
          of Christian morality he mistook to be
          tiie desire of the individual to save his
          soul, and thus boldly stated, this seems
          a most ignoble aim. It is only when
          one realizes that what meant was that
          each individual should strive to sub-
          Iject his lower nature to his higher in
          tiie interests of all that fine sees that
          our western religion and our Teutonic
          philosopher were reall aiming at one
          and the same mark: To make of man
          "A DOCTOR FOR SICK SOULS."
          It Is unnecessary to point out how
          alien is Nietzsche's whole attitude of
          mind to the American temper. He ab
          hored commercialism, hunmanitarian
          isni. facile optimism, any form of cas
          ual, easy-going light-heartedness. The
          very foundation of his philosophy was
          to admit an evil world; to make no
          such slim excuses for it as that it was
          the best of all possible worlds whiles
          most tilings in it were necessarily
          evils.
          It was suffering and compliance and
          a broken spirit, thought Nietzsche,
          which had finally condoled itself with
          inventing a Heaven and a hereafter in
          which to store its jos It was a
          "an arrow and an aspiration after su
          perman "' Again, Nietsche objected to
          shifting the burden of improving' life
          upon God ar upon evolution. Man by
          deliberate choice and by imposing- his
          will was to create values and affirm a
          worthy life. This is the meaning of
          his proclamation in "Zarathushtra.":
          "God is dead. Now, men," he calls,
          "it is your time to make an effort;
          to create worth for life, since there is
          no outside help. The very roots 7f
          good and evil are in your own hearts;
          they are not in life. In chance, in
          luck or in the hereafter." The proc
          lamation is amazingly like one made
          long before: "The kingdom of-Heaveii
          is within you." Louise Collier Wil
          cox, in North American Review.

                    <text>The Ruling Superman Is Scientific Knowledge Built Up by
            the Millions and Controlled by Them.
            This picture shows the superman of Nietzsche's world-
            ruliner dream an abnormal creature, broodinp" on the abvss.
            his friends, and only friends, an eagle and a snake.
            Excellent companions, typical of the superman's cre
            ator, Nietzsche, whose thought sometimes soars like the
            eagle to noblest heights and more often crawls like a serpent
            tempting to baseness.
            "I teach you beyond-man. Man is something that shall
            be surpassed," said Nietzsche.
            "God is dead," said Nietzsche. The will of the super
            man Was to rule. He presents the body of the people ig
            norant, stupid, hating wisdom, delighting in a rope dancer.
            The rope dancer falls; is crushed, and, dying, exclaims:
            "I knew it long ago that the devil would play me a
            trick. Now he draggeth me unto hell; art thou going to
            hinder him?"
            "On my honor, friend," Zarathustra answered, "what
            thou speakest of doth not exist; there is no devil or hell.
            Thy soul will be dead even sooner than thy body; hencefor
            ward fear nothing."
            There is the doctrine of Nietzsche that went down to in
            sanity, and there the doctrine of Prussia that will go down
            to defeat.

            Nietzsche, no superman, but one brutally disregarding
            right and morality, died a maniac, when he hoped to live
            and dominate the world of thought.
            Prussia, dreamine of world conquest, of super-rule on
            earth,' will end as miserably as her son Nietzsche, the
            prophet of Prussianism.
            The superman that Nietzsche painted, the beyond-man
            ruling as an individual, will never be. The human rac?
            will be held down forever to that equality of power that
            makes for brotherhood.
            But on earth the superman dwells and rules already.
            He is made up of all the good, all the power, science,
            benevolence, contained in the combined brains of the human
            race.
            Nietzsche dreamed of beyond-man with an eagle for his
            slave. What would he have said of today's super-race, con
            trolling great flocks of flying machines, every one flying
            higher, faster and farther than any eagle?
            What would this oracle of super-selfishness' have said
            could he see the United States today building a fleet of ten
            thousand super-eagles that will take dynamite to Prussia
            and prove that the superman is named JUSTICE, not
            Nietzsche, Zarathustra, or Hohenzollern?
            Every one of us little human beings, working together
            on the earth, making it and ourselves better, century after
            century, has a right to rejoice in the existence of a super
            man. To show a giant pulling a tree up by the roots, tearing
            open the jaws of a lion, carrying five thousand pounds on his
            back, hewing his way through an army, such were the utmost
            thoughts of those that planned the superman of old Greek
            days, or of modern Prussia.
            The real superman is the intelligent, ordinary human
            being, plus science.
            A child two years old can pull a switch and with an
            electric magnet, using power invisible, lift a hundred thou
            sand pounds of steel rails.
            Man can build a derrick that will lift a battleship.
            He uses in his forges steel, electric and hydraulic ham
            mers with which he can delicately and accurately crack a
            nut or hammer a great sheet of steel into any shape desired.
            Nietzsche's beyond-man was to send his eagle flying
            through the air at about fifty miles an hour.
            Super-science sends its messages by telegraph without (
            wires at a speed seven times round the earth in one second, i
            Zarathustra called to his eagle in the air Man Bpeaks '
            to a ship three thousand miles out on the Pacific and in
            stantaneously receives his answer.
            The superman of science does more, and does better
            than all childish imagining could plan.
            It builds palaces of steel and glass over night
            city destroyed is rebuilt in a year.
            Super-science constructs a machine with a million fin
            gers to make cloth of cotton, linen, silk, and wool. It creates
            the machine for sewing, with a needle that flies faster than
            eyesight and frees millions of women from slavery. almost human he left me and i
            From oil in the ground science extracts the exnlosive 'h'n he ought to pay me for my
            force that enables man to fly through the air, rush over the
            ground in a machine moved by millions of explosions, plow
            his fields and cut down the forests with that same explosive
            power.
            The real beyond-man is the gas engine, electric sweep
            ing machine, wireless telegraph, submarine, flying machine,
            DYNAMITE.
            You know Nietzsche, the German thinker. He
            worked with the mentalpower of a dozen men, and died
            in the madhouse, having done moro than a thousand to
            start Prussia on its present vicious campaign of world
            conquest.
            He taught selfishness and brutal use of power, he
            preached in his "Thus Spake Zarathustra" of tho super
            man or beyond-man that should rule ill others, a giant
            bending the little people to his will.
            The individual Prussian liked to think of himself
            as superman and of Prussia as an all-ruling super-race.
            Nietzsche, marvelous in power, died in the mad
            house, and Prussia will end her disastrous effort at
            super-conquest in miserable failure and defeat</text>

            Just Arrived—Fancy Colored
            German Philosophy.
            The following report of the Min
            ers' Meeting in Philadelphia will be
            read with interest: An interesting
            discussion on the cause of the pres
            ent world war enlivened the meet
            ing of the Presbyterian Ministerial
            Union in the Witnerspoon Building.
            Tlie debate was occasioned by an ad
            dress by Rev. William Hallo(^i John
            son, a professor in Lincoln univers
            ity, who attributed the war to the in
            fluence of Nietzsche's philosophy.
            The history and racial pedUlarities
            of tlie German people and their out
            reach for world mastery in trade
            were also causes of the present war,
            the speaker said.
            The connection of German phil
            osophy and theology wit.h the war
            were traced. "Nietzsche,, standing
            at the climax of this development,
            was more thorough-going than any
            of his predecessors." the speaker
            said. "Treitschke had complained
            that the Germans, while creative in
            other lines of activity, did homage
            to a foreign religion but Nietzsche
            removed this obstacle, so that a
            German religion of valor and of
            force was substituted for Christian
            ity and thus the spirit of militarism
            could have free course 'and be glori
            fied. Others had spoken of war as
            a regretable necessity, but- Nietz
            sche taught that it was the duty of
            man ruthlessly to exercise his will
            to power, and so war became the
            highest of duties. Every atrocity in
            Belgium or in Armenia can find its
            defense in Nietzsche's writings. His
            doctrine of the superman became,
            in the popular mind, the belief that
            the Germans were a super race, des

        <text>Nietzsche's "Antichrist" Proves, on Reading, To Be Anti-Paul
            A Rebel's Outburst
            Nietzsche's lifelong Antipathy to Christianity
            Concentrated in "The Antichrist"
            FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE is one
            of the most discussed and
            most misunderstood philosoph?
            ic?! thirikers of all time. Pos?
            sessed of an extraordinarily complex
            and finely wrought intellect and of a
            remarkable faculty for literary expres?
            sion, his work is characterized by the
            double subtlety of the seer and of the
            poet. To understand him even meas?
            urably well is an achievement of no
            little distinction: It requires charity
            and broad knowledge and freedom from
            prejudice.
            Unfortunately most of Nietzsche's
            critics have been neither charitable
            nor learned, nor free from prejudice.
            Unlike most philosophers, Nietzsche
            had a habit of expressing provocative
            ideas in a provocative manner. As a
            result his works have attracted a great
            deal of unintelligent praise and a great
            deal of Ignorant and malignant ani?
            madversion. One of the most wide?
            spread misconceptions about the trend
            and significance of Nietzsche's thought
            is amusingly illustrated by the follow?
            ing anecdote told by Mr. H. L. Mencken
            in his introduction to a new edition of
            "The Antichrist" ( Knopf) ^
            The "Monster, Nietzsky"
            "On the strength of the fact that I
            had published a book on Nietzsche in
            1900, six years after his death, I was
            called upon by agents of the Depart?
            ment of Justice, elaborately outfitted
            with badges, to meet the charge that
            I was an Intim?t* associate and agent
            of the German monster, Nietzsky.' I
            quote the oficial prosas verbal, an In?
            dignant, but often misspelled, docu?
            ment."
            Probably moat educated Americans,
            unlike the Department of Justice, know
            that Nietzsche has been dead for some
            twenty years and know how to spell
            his name. But many people who ought
            to know better still insist, perhaps for
            the sake of euphony, on grouping him
            with (he two conventional apostles of
            Prussian militarism, Treitschke and
            Bernhardt Now, it is doubtful whether
            a man ever lived more devoid of na?
            tionalist feeling than Friedrich Nietz?
            sche. Far from being proud of hi a
            German origin, he did his best, in
            spite of the genealogical records, to
            prove himself a Pole. He lived most
            of his life in Switzerland and Italy.
            He never for a moment shared the de?
            lusion that the modern Germane were
            a superior race, fitted to conquer and
            dominate the world. On the contrary,
            his writings abound in bitter strictures
            against German stupidity, and he de?
            lighted in drawing contrasts between
            German and French culture, much to
            the disadvantage of the former. His
            infrequent references to biB supposed
            colleague, Treitschke, are couched in
            Anything but complimentary language,
            rom the viewpoint of Anglo-Saxon
            morality Nietzsche has enough sins to
            answer for without loading him down
            with an association with Prussian mili?
            tarism, which he would be the first to
            repudiate.
            Not Wholly Greek
            Mr. .Mencken describes Nietzsche as
            "a Greek born two thousand years too
            late." This is true, but it in not the
            whole truth. The Greek element in
            Nietzsche was very strong, and accounts
            for his hearty contempt for such Chris?
            tian doctrines as sin, redemption and
            the purification of the soul through
            the mortification of the body. Among
            the civilized races of antiquity the
            Greeks were perhaps the most intellect?
            ual, the least spiritual, the least in?
            clined to console themselves for the
            misfortunes of this life by conjuring
            up visions of other worldly bliss.
            But no Greek of the fifth century
            B. C. would have been likely to dis?
            play Nietzsche's fanatical intensity in
            attacking religion. By a curious para?
            dox the philosopher's long line of pious
            ancestors (his forefathers for several
            generations were Lutheran pastors)
            may fairly be held responsible for his
            most violent diatribes against Christi?
            anity. Take the sentences of wild de?
            nunciation that appear near the end of
            "The Antichrist":
            "I condemn Christianity; I bring
            against the Christian Church the most
            terrible of all the accusations that an
            accuser has ever had in his mouth. It
            Is, to me, the greatest of all imaginable
            corruptions; it seeks to work the ulti?
            mate corruption, the worst possible cor?
            ruption. The Christian Church has left
            nothing untouched by Its depravity; it
            has turned every value into worthless
            neos, and every truth into a lie, and
            every integrity into baseness of soul."
            This is not the language of a con?
            vinced skeptic, but of a perverted
            evangelist, turning the batteries of his
            moral earnestness against something
            which he believes to be false. Despite
            all his expressed contempt for Chris?
            tian asceticism, Nietzsche, in his own
            "??v, is a good deal of an ascetic him?
            self, a St. Simon Stylites of atheism.
            He is never more sincere, more impas?
            sioned than when he is setting forth
            the dangers and hardships of the intel?
            lectual life. So, denouncing faith as an
            easy means of evading the responsibili
            tles of intellectual integrity, he says:
            Faith Denounced.
            "Man has bad to fight for every atom
            of the truth, and has had to pay for
            it almost everything that the heart,
            that human love, that human trust
            cling to. Greatness of soul is needed
            for this business; the service of truth
            is the hardest of all services. "What,
            then, is the meaning of integrity in
            things intellectual? It means that a
            mas must be severe with his own heart,
            that he must scorn 'beautiful feelings,'
            aad' that he makes every Yea and Nay
            a matter of conscience! Faith makes
            blessed: therefore it lies."
            Despite its title "The Antichrist" is
            not so much anti-Christ as anti-Paul.
            Nietzsche maintains the theory that
            the original teachings of Jesus, teach?
            ings of quietism and spiritual anar?
            chism, wore perverted by Puul into a
            <
            creed of hatred and revengo, a creed
            that spitefully disparaged health and
            joy and exalted sidelines? and sorrow,
            To him Paul is the incarnation of
            priestcraft; and he lavishes upon him
            every abusive epithet in his vocabu?
            lary. Except for the last few pages
            the book shows little evidence of any
            mental strain or weakness, although
            it was written only a short time before
            the author's tragic mental break-down.
            As always Nietzsche writes bitterly,
            vehemently, passionately; but his anal?
            ysis of the spiritual origin of Chris?
            tianity, although envenomed with hos?
            tile prejudice, is supported by sound
            historical and philosophical scholar?
            ship. The charm of the author's style,
            its combined flexibility and vigor, is
            admirably preserved in Mr. Mencken's
            translation.
            It is difficult to contemplate Nietz?
            sche, always tortured but never broken
            by the twin devils of sickness and
            loneliness, and always pursuing his
            ideals at whatever cost of spiritual
            suffering, without conceiving a measure
            of sympathy and admiration for the
            man, however much one may disagree
            with or condemn his views. And it seems
            appropriate that "The Antichrist," one
            of his last rebellious outbursts, should
            be written without a trace of weaken?
            ing or compromise. Tho sword of his
            keen and powerful intellect was soon to
            be Irretrievably broken; but to the
            very end he kept his hand on its hilt
            and his face toward the enemy.

            Thomas Mann Blasts
            Nietzsche Barbarism
            That Guided Hitler
            By Carter Brooke Jones
            Nietzsche's hypothetical superman,
            who served Hitler as a model, was ι
            called "the maximum' in barbarism"
            by Thomas Mann, the famous Ger
            man novelist, in a lecture last night
            at Coolidge Auditorium in the Li
            brary of Congress.
            Summing up Nietzsche's philosophy
            in the light of contemporary events,
            Dr. Mann said the 19th century in
            tellectual rebel had flashed across
            the sky "like summer lightning,"
            pointing to the dawn of a new time.
            Dr. Mann, who won the Nobel
            Prize in 1929, fled Germany when
            the Nazis came into power and be
            came an American citizen, dissect
            ed the German philosopher's genius.
            He pointed to the fantastic direction
            it finally took and the fundamental
            errors it compiled. The author was
            by turns scathing, dramatic and
            compassionate as he took Nietzsche's
            concepts apart and held them up ior
            the audience to see.
            Genius Involved Malady.
            "What made him die an agonizing |
            death on the cross of thought?" Dr..
            Mann asked, considering the dissolu- \
            tion of the philosopher in madness. |
            And Dr. Mann spoke of the malady :
            Nietzsche contracted when he ex- ■
            perimented with vice after a pious, J
            ascetic adolescence and early man
            hood. "This illness," said Dr. Mann,
            "was intertwined and connected with j
            his genius." which came to drift ;
            "into tractless wastes."
            Who, Dr. Mann asked, tried to
            put into effect phases of Nietzsche's
            teachings, such as the urging that
            the unfit be destroyed, the saying
            that life was not in need of justice,
            but of "unjustice?" The answer
            obviously was "the -Fascist Fuhrer."
            None who has seen the efforts
            of the Fasciste to apply some of
            Nietzsche's philosophy literally, even
            if he may have meant it at times
            ironically, can read it today with
            amusement, Dr. Mann pointed out.
            Some of Nietzsche's writings, In the
            light of what has happened to the
            world since, "appears today like the is
            talk of an excited adolescent." These
            included his idea of war as a selec
            tive process for the betterment of I
            mankind, a weeding out and a
            ciearsinr. tœ
            Quotes Oscar Wilde.
            Dr. Mann quoted some epigrams i
            which came, not from the daring 18
            philosopher who was admired by ! 1
            many "liberals" at the turn of the!ρ
            century and later, but from Oscar ff
            Wilde. These "might well have been t
            stated in Nietzsche's writings," the M
            speaker added. j||
            "This Τ realize is a sort of sac- ! Û
            rilege," Dr. Mann remarked. "Wilde !l|
            was a dandy, while Nietzsche was a M
            saint of immoralism."
            Nietzsche's "will to power," the Ρ
            chief tenet in his philosophy, came j|
            to take Its place "in the trashy %
            ideology of fascism," Dr. Mann

                            Preiderick Nietzsche was born in
                            1844 and died in 1900. He had lived
                            long enough to leave a Philosophy of
                            war, which Germany is attempting to
                            put into practice today. We blame
                            -Bismarck’s “blood-and-iron” policy for
                            the present struggle among the na
                            tions; hut it was Friedrich Nietzsche
                            who expended a merely brutal phrase
                            into daring and capitivating philoso
                            phy, which has cast a fatal spell upon
                            the rulers of Germany, from the
                            kaiser downwards.
                            Take as a starting-point a book re
                            cently published and much reviewed,
                            entitled “Germany and the Next
                            War,” written by Count Bernhardi,
                            himself a German general. This vol
                            ume bears on its title-page as a motto
                            we of Nietzsche’s typical aphorism’s;
                            —“War and courage have done more
                            great things than the love of the
                            neighbor.” But this is not all; for
                            Bernhardi employs the ground-work of
                            Nietzsche’s philosophy to advocate
                            the wisdom and necessity of armed
                            strife. The basis of Nietzsche’s
                            arguments is to be found in a sup
                            posed lesson from the science of
                            fetology—namely, “Nature red in tooth
                            and claw”; and over and over again
                            does the philosopher turn to biology
                            foar instances to buttress his barbaric
                            evangel. “But at any rate there is
                            hope in the exact sciences, and most
                            cf all in biology.” Turn now to Bern
                            hardi; and what do we read? “War
                            is a biological necessity, an indispen
                            sable regulartor in the life of man
                            kind, failing which would result a
                            course of evolution deleterious to the
                            species, as well as utterly antagonis
                            tic to all culture. War, said Heracli
                            tus,, is the father of all things. With
                            out war, inferior or demoralised
                            races would only too easily swamp
                            the healthy and vital ones, and gen
                            eral decadence would be the conse
                            quence. "War is one of the essential
                            factors to morality. If circumstances
                            require, it is not only the right, but
                            the moral and political duty, of a
                            statesman to bring about a war.”
                            Thus we see a plain soldier impress
                            ing a modern science and ancient pa-|
                            gan writer in justification of his own
                            profession. "Where did the soldier
                            find his learning? In the writings of
                            Nietzsche, who was a student of biol
                            ogy and professor of classical philos
                            ophy.
                            The fact is that Nietzsche has be
                            come the bible of the military caste
                            in Germany. His dazzling rhetoric
                            and diction have glorified war into “a
                            thing of beauty.” More dangerous
                            still is the praise he pours upon the
                            class he calls supreme—the rulers of
                            the future —who are to be, above all
                            else, lords of war. It is not wonderful
                            that he has caught many impetuous
                            minds in his alluring net; nor is it
                            remarkable that his writings are be
                            ing read today even by the bellicose
                            tyrants of South American republics.
                            Let us now attempt to explain the
                            amazing philosophy of Nietzsche, and
                            in the process there will be discover
                            ed a parallel to the present policy of
                            Germany which is realty startling.
                            Nietzsche knew for whom he was
                            writing; and he pens thus: —“The
                            real philosophers are commanders
                            and law givers.** His ideal society
                            was a pyramid, with "the king above
                            all, as the highest formula of war
                            rior, judge, and keeper of the law.”
                            Surrounding the king are the war
                            riors, who are “the guardians of
                            right, the keepers of order and se
                            curity,” as also “the executive of the
                            most Intellectual.” Under this caste
                            are the medicore ones whose business
                            is buying and selling; and beneath
                            all are the drudges, who must be
                            policed and watched lest they should
                            indulge in dreams of democracy. Is
                            not this a counterpart of the Germany
                            of today? Yes, it may be answered,
                            and perhaps of other countries, too.

                            nificance of the social pyramid in
                            Germany particularly. The goal of
                            Nietzsche’s philosophy is the evolu
                            tion of what he called the super
                            man, and the founding of an empire
                            to be known as “United Europe.”
                            These twin visions have inflamed the
                            hearts of the ruling caste of the social
                            pyramid of Germany. Nietzsche con
                            ceived of the superman both as a type
                            and as a particular person; and the
                            completest embodiment of his ideal
                            he found so far in Napoleon, who was
                            half-superman and'biff animal. But
                            there was yet to 'arise another super
                            man of nobler birth, xiature,* and pres

                            Where would this paladin Appear?
                            Nietzsche did not say “in Germany”
                            explicitly—that would have been too
                            obvious flattery—but from his criti
                            cism of the alleged poor qualities of
                            modern great peoples, except the
                            German, it is apparent that he looked
                            upon the Fatherland as the birth
                            place of the warrior king and the
                            warrior race of men who were to
                            transform the face of the world.
                            Great ones might be found elsewhere,
                            indeed, fit to be enrolled among the
                            company of the supermen, but the
                            momentum which was to produce the
                            whole type of superman would flow
                            from Germany. One quality Nietz

                            knights must possess, which was not
                            possessed by Napoleon—namely, aj
                            clean life physically —and the worst
                            detractors of the Emperor William
                            have never hinted that he does not
                            fulfill in this respect Nietzsche’s
                            ideal. But, as will be shown, all other
                            moralities, such as we kown them,
                            were to count as nothing, and, indeed,
                            were to be held in contempt. The
                            first aim of society is the support of
                            the superman; towards that all in
                            dustry shall be directed: —“I love
                            him who liveth in order to know,
                            and seeketh to know in order that
                            the superman may hereafter live. I
                            love him who laboureth and inves

                            however, is the superman.” Nietz

                            The warrior king and his warrior
                            race of men would conquer the world,
                            and, as a first installment, would
                            found ‘“The United States of Europe.”
                            “More fresh air,” cries Nietzsche,
                            more fresh air, for heaven’s sake!
                            This condition of Europe must not
                            last any longer. Is there a single idea
                            behind this bovine nationalism?”
                            Which reminds one curiously of the
                            kaiser’s excited demand for “A place
                            in the sun,” just as the tearing up of
                            the treaty safeguarding Belgium, and
                            the frank acknowledgement of the in
                            fraction by the German chancellor,
                            imitated Neitzsche’s own contempt
                            for “bovine nationalism.” Does any
                            one think the parallel is being pushed
                            too far? If so, how can the doubter
                            explain this further fact —that from
                            the day of his cornation the kaiser
                            has steadily set his face against be
                            ing styled ‘“the German Emperor?”
                            He calles himself “the Emperor of
                            Germany,” and will brook no other
                            title. In other words, he belongs to
                            no nationality; Germany is in poten

                            over which there will rule only one
                            emperor. This matter of the kaiser’s
                            choice of title might be merely amus

                            again had pointed the way:—“Oh, my
                            brethren, I consecrate you, and
                            point you anew nobility: ye shall
                            become procreators and cultivators
                            and sow’ers of the future."
                            “Let it not be your honour hence
                            forth whence ye came but whither ye
                            go.” “Oh, my brethern.
                            not backward shall your nobility
                            gaze, but outward? Exiles shall ye
                            be from all fatherlands and fore
                            father lands.” “Your
                            children’s land shall ye love, let this
                            be your new* nobility—the undiscov

                            I bid your sails seach and seach! ”
                            Events have proved how’ the hearts
                            of the rulers of Germany have be
                            come inflamed by Nietzsche’s twin
                            visions of the superman and conquest
                            of the world. In themselves, these
                            ambitions, though arrogant, are not
                            ignoble. It is when we come to con
                            sider the moral sanctions which shall
                            entitle the superman to override the
                            earth, at the expense of all other
                            human beings, that there stands ex

                            tionary conspiracy in history. At
                            this stage, Nietzsche formulates his
                            doctrine of “The Will to Power.” He
                            knew that all nations recognized and
                            defended “The, Will to Live:” there
                            fore he goes further—not existence
                            but conquest is the lesson to be learn
                            ed. As usual, he takes his argument
                            from biology:—“Wherever I found a
                            living thing, there found I the Will
                            to Power: and even in the will of the
                            servant found I the will to be mas
                            ter. Neither necessity nor desire, but
                            the love of power, is the demon of
                            mankind. You may give men every
                            thing possible—health, rood, shelter,
                            enjoyment—but they are and remain
                            unhappy and capricious, for the de

                            satisfied.” .... “Passion for

                            besides premature answers: passion

                            man creepeth and croucheth and

                            hereafter “the criterion of truth:” a
                            lie, in short, as we understand it,
                            was not a lie if it made for power. As
                            we shall see, this doctrine is no mere
                            variation of, or playing with, the
                            phrase that “might is right;” in the
                            mind of Nietzsche, as in the minds
                            of his disciples of today, and espec
                            ially in the minds of the ruling caste
                            in Prussia, it involved nothing less
                            than the overtuning of all the moral
                            codes of humanity and Christianity.
                            Nietzsche saw clearly that Europe
                            in general -respected a humanitarian
                            code of morality; and that the chief
                            custodian and advocate of this code
                            was the Christian church. Forthwith
                            he attacked the conception of God,
                            the teaching of the Christian church
                            and the virtues that are now recogniz
                            ed among men. We need not quote his
                            | judgment upon the conception of
                            God, of the doctrinal teachings of the
                            Christian Church, for the simple rea
                            son that in the ears of most they
                            would sound blasphemous; also we
                            can better bring the argument to
                            earth by quoting his pronouncements
                            where they refer chiefly to the vir
                            tues practised by civilized mankind:
                            —“The most general effect, the most
                            complete transformation that Chris
                            tianity has produced in Europe is
                            perhaps the fact that the man who
                            performs, social sympathetic, disin
                            terested, and benovolent actions is
                            now considered as the moral man.”
                            This transformation he regards as a
                            curse, and would have restored the
                            desire for power, the fighting, the
                            envy and so forth, which he believed
                            to be the marks of ancient pagan
                            Europe. “Pity” he decried espcially
                            as being the offspring of Christanity.
                            “Pity is opposed to the tonic passions
                            which enhance the energy of the feel
                            ing of life; its action is depressing.
                            A man loses power when he pities.”
                            Having swept ideas, religion and
                            morality, as we hold them, out of his
                            way, Neitzsche next proceeds to des

                            “Higher Men,” whom he would have
                            to conquer the world. Very signifi
                            cant is the fact that he discovered
                            the germ of his new morality in “The

                            ra.” Nietzsche found that this an
                            cient Greek, in defending oligarchy
                            against democracy, employed the
                            word “good” and “bad” as synony
                            mous with “high-born” and “plebian.”
                            Well, seeing that the Superman
                            were to be by birth and interllect
                            the aristocrats of Europe, it followed
                            that the new tables of m^
                            should be on the lines indicated by
                            the aristocratic pagan who had given
                            the clue. Nietzsche .then drew up his
                            code of “master” and “slave” morali
                            ty. The “masters” were to be athe
                            ists and amoralists, enemies of the
                            conception of God and the feelings of
                            average mankind; but, on the other
                            hand, they were to be loyal, to their
                            own exalted slaves:—’“Profound rev

                            longed revenge—both only within the
                            circle of equals—artfulness in retali

                            think of lowering our duties to the
                            rank of duties for everybody; to be
                            unwilling to renounce or share our
                            responsibilities; to count our preroga
                            tive, and the exercise of them, among
                            our duties.”
                            Regarding the “slaves'* Nietzsche
                            is not so explicit. He would allow
                            them to remain in their ignorance
                            worshipping God, because, among the
                            folks who “exist for service and gene
                            ral utility, religion produces peace
                            of heart and ennoblement of obedi
                            ence,” and “religion is an additional
                            means for overcomming resistance in
                            the exercise of authority;” wherefore
                            there would be left to the “slaves”
                            “the pillars of their existence and the
                            soporific appliances toward happi
                            ness.” That is, the atheists Superman
                            is entitled to take the name of God
                            upon his lips when addressing the
                            multitude, while at the same time
                            he hurls from his hand the thunder
                            bolts of war.
                            Just here It may be asked in which
                            class Nietsche would place Britons
                            who “never shall be slaves.” Is Is
                            sufficient to recall merely this, that
                            the British, being largely a commer
                            cial people, are In general beneath
                            the castes comprising the Supermen;
                            and would make most serviceable
                            “hewers of wood and drawers of
                            water.” The Supermen, having found
                            ed “the United States of Europe,”
                            would next, supported by British
                            commerce, proceed to the conquest of
                            the world. Admiral Mahan, of Ameri
                            ca, hinted at this project in his re
                            cent article advocating the cause of
                            Britain in this war.
                            Let us now gather up some of the
                            points made:—(l) The Supermen are
                            a military caste, presumably emanat
                            ing from Germany; (2) their goal is
                            the founding of “the United States of
                            Europe,” and thereafter the conquest
                            of the globe; (3) in order to justify
                            their enterprise, they would destroy
                            all conceptions of Christianity and
                            the virtues of humanity; (4) they
                            would Invent anew morality, based
                            upon the respective rights of “mast
                            ers” and “slaves.”
                            What now becomes clear? That
                            this war is truly Armageddon, “the
                            struggle between the powers of good
                            and of evil.” Something else' also be
                            comes clear —namely, that there Is
                            no reason for wonder in the fact that
                            German statesmen break their words,
                            seeing that in their view power is
                            “the criterion of truth” and national
                            ism is “bovine;” also, that the offi
                            cial German military Gazette means
                            what it says—“ Woe to the vanquish
                            ed.” There was more than rhetoric
                            in the description by a prominent
                            French journalist when he wrote of
                            “barbarians rushing against civiliza
                            tion.”
                            The problem that next presented
                            itself to Nietzsche’s mind vras how
                            best to bring about the great enter
                            prise; and this is his answer—“ The
                            changes and transformations which
                            have hitherto taken place in morals
                            were caused by successful crimes.”
                            By the force of his own argument he
                            now necessarily praises war: that is
                            to be “the successful crime” which
                            shall usher in the new mankind and
                            the new morality of “master” and
                            “slaves:” "war and courage have done
                            more great things than charity. What
                            is the good? ye ask. To be brave is
                            good. Live your life of obedience

                            red war,” hnd his is the siren set
                            luring to destruction. How deeply hi
                            panegyric of devastation has infected
                            the mind of General Bernhardi has
                            been already shown: and Bernhardi
                            •is only one in the Superman Pen-
                            Germanic ring of “blood and iron”
                            which surrounds the Kaiser’s throne.
                            European morals being still of a
                            Christian or civilized order, Nietzsche
                            must needs look, or pretend to look,
                            for a plausible pretext which shall
                            permit the Superman to throw out
                            his challenge; and he points to an at
                            tack upon Russia, primitive and colos

                            the real end out of sight. The real
                            end, as we have seen, was the des
                            troying of present civilization and the
                            planting of the race of Supermen “in
                            the lands of the remotest seas.”
                            Colonies! Unboubtedly. French
                            Colonies today; British Colonies to
                            morrow; or both at the same time.
                            Nietzsche taught Germany to believe
                            that she could crush the British peo
                            ple—“A ' fundamentally medicore

                            from Shakespeare down, are “mud
                            dle-headed,” and so on.
                            Fed upon such stuff, the warmon
                            gers of Germany prepared for and en
                            tered upon their present task. No
                            doubt they thought the hazard suffi
                            ently perilous; but Neitzsche thought
                            so too; yet he advised them to take
                            the risk—“Man is a rope stretched
                            between the animal and the Super
                            man —a 1 rope over an abyss. A
                            dangerous crossing, a dangerous war
                            faring, a dangerous looking-back, a
                            dangerus trembling and halting.”
                            Nevertheless, he urges the command,
                            “Forward,” and shouts to his Super
                            man three watch-words —-“Courage*”
                            “Hope,” “Illusions.” The last is the
                            most interesting—“ln the present
                            state of knowledge, illusions, logical
                            fiction, false opinions (to which syn
                            thetic judgment apriori belong) are
                            the most indispensable to us; often
                            more than truth they are life-further
                            ing, life-preserving, species-preserv
                            ing, perhaps species-rearing.”
                            Well, the rope over the abyss is
                            Germany’s million of soldiers. Over
                            the backs of these ordinary men do
                            the Supermen essay to enter into a
                            new world —or fall into the abyss.
                            One word more. Nietzsche died
                            mad; he imagined himself at succes
                            sive periods in his “last phase” to be,
                            first, a notorious murderer; second,
                            King of Italy; and, last of all, God.

                            ■bien definidas: el artista y el filósofo.
                            El primero es “europeo”: el segundo
                            es “alemán”. El primero es un ena
                            morado de la antigua Grecia á la que
                            glorificó en sus libros y en su cátedra
                            de la universidad de Basilea. El se
                            gundo es el propagandista de la fuerza,
                            de la energía, de la voluntad, del “sen
                            y el llegar á ser”, base de la filosofía
                            alemana.
                            Sus primeras obras fueron producto
                            de sus visiones artísticas. Cuando las
                            escribió, todavía no se había entregado
                            á la filosofía. Era lo que se llama un
                            “europeista”. En una de esas obras,

                            constitución, renunció la cátedra que

                            por completo á la filosofía, y aquí surge

                            la vitalidad de su pueblo. Y al mismo
                            tiempo que Bismarck proclamaba como
                            “el primer derecho la fuerza”, Nietzs

                            bustecerse y no apoyar á los débiles.”
                            Entonces escribe “Así hablaba Zarat
                            liustra”, libro que no es otra cosa que

                            bro dice: “¿ Qué es lo bueno ? todo lo
                            que promueve el sentimiento del poder,
                            la voluntad de obtener la fuerza, el po

                            malo? todo lo que brota de la debilidad.
                            ¿Qué es la felicidad? El sentimiento
                            de que la fuerza va creciendo, de que se
                            ha vencido una resistencia.” La filoso
                            fía de Nietzsche es, pues, esencialmen
                            te alemana., y en nada se diferencia de
                            la Fichte, de la Freitschte, de la von
                            Berñhardi, porque esa, y no otra, es la
                            filosofía alemana: un idealismo que tie
                            ne por base la energía y la voluntad.
                            Es un error decir que Nietzsche no

                            porque Nietzsche quiso ser músico y
                            Wagner se burló de él. Sostuvieron una

                            No puede ser, pues, esa obra la que
                            refleje la alta mentalidad de Nietzsche.

                            schale! Man braucht nicht weiter zu
                            gehen, um die geistigen Süßlichkeiten zu
                            suchen. Augenscheinlich ist daraus er

                            der Mut mangelte ihnen, den tausend

                            fängt Nietzsche schon im Buche

                            im ersten Artikel an, „Hebet die Che

                            zu schreiben. Das war wunderbar,
                            und er hätte es nicht besser machen
                            können, selbst wenn ihm jemand rat
                            lich beigestanden wäre. Denn die Be
                            griffe und Empfindungen unter eine
                            chemikalische Perspektive zu setzen,
                            das war mehr, als sich noch je ein
                            Mensch hatte denken können. Er bc

                            vor. Mit dieser wohlausgearbeiteten
                            Persepktive läßt er den Heroldruf an
                            die freien Geister erschallen! Dieselben
                            sollen fleißig an den Untersuchungen

                            und dann erst zu diesbezüglichen
                            Schlußfolgerungen zu kommen. In
                            zwischen sollen sie nicht die äußeren
                            Dinge berücksichtigen, die öffentlich
                            feil geboten werden, sondern ihren
                            Halt auf dieser Erde suchen und der
                            freien Lüge die Maske vom Gesicht

                            Um nicht mißverstanden zu werden,
                            schreibt er im zweiten Artikel, über
                            die viertausendjähcige Mißdeutung der
                            philosophischen Festsetzung von
                            Grundlagen. Dieselbe hatte in zu
                            geringen Maaße am Ursprünge des
                            Menscken selbst die enthüllende Un

                            sich durch die Jahrtausende wenig
                            vsycholog'sck verändert! Deswegen
                            wäre es kindisch, die Scheinwahrheit
                            der Teleologie als reines Gold hinzu
                            nehmen! Darum stellte er sich in eine
                            energische Positur dagegen, um das
                            von der 5tultur verherrlichte Ding

                            stab mißt er auch die Kunst, die wohl

                            Um die Teleologenkunst besser an
                            die Wand zu malen, zitiiert er uns
                            die Astrologie und Verwandtes. Hier
                            konnte man fast von Entzücken sterben,
                            so klar ist die Sache beschrieben. Alles
                            verständlich und erhaben. Der Mensch
                            glaubt, mit seinen ästeiisch-logischen,
                            religiös moralischen Empfindungen
                            an das Herz der Welt zu rühren, hat
                            ater nicht den Mut, sich wissenschaft
                            lich auszubilden und sich zu verge
                            wissern. daß das Herz der Welt er
                            eigentlich selbst sei! Daraus ergiebt
                            sich, daß die Menschen die äußerlichen
                            Dinge kennen und nicht sich selbst!
                            Mit dieser Vergewisserung kommen
                            iiudb die Träume, die erst richtig die
                            Vorstellungsweise bilden, mit welcher
                            oie wahre Götterwelt gebaut wird!
                            Wie untersucht man wissenschaft
                            lich eine so wichtige allgemein- wohl
                            unterstützte Sache, wie da teleologische
                            System? Für Jene, die das Leben und
                            seine Hemmung mit offenkundig auf
                            richtigem Sinn beobachten, scheint
                            dies eine sehr einfache Frage zu sein.
                            Man untersucht alles Korn für Korn,
                            man verteilt die Körner an die wohler
                            wogenen Plätze, und bezeichnet sie als
                            gut oder schlecht! In dieser Wohlde
                            zeichneten Richtung hin arbeitend, er
                            hält man die für das menschliche Leben
                            richtige Antwort. In diesem Werke
                            wird kein Ding zu wichtig oder gar
                            übersinnlich und so unmöglich, sondern
                            alles bleibt klar und rein, wie die
                            Sonne! Man empfindet sich als Teil
                            der physisch sichtbaren und nicht der
                            metaphysisch unsichtbaren Dinge
                            und Richtungen. Dadurch ftihlt man
                            sich sicher aus der Erde und verzichtet
                            auf das Reich hinter den Wolken. Des
                            wegen wird nur das interessant, was
                            man bis zum letzten Körnchen sehen
                            und greifen kann! Für diese vorsorg

                            oder Philosophie. Man überzeugt sich
                            des nötigen Wissens für sick selbst, und
                            lehnt die Lehren der herrschenden Ton
                            angeber ab, um in kurzen Worten zu
                            sagen: ich bin einmal hier und kann es
                            mir schon erlauben das Leben und was
                            dasselbe umgibt, Korn für Korn zu un
                            tersuchen! Was dabei herauskommt,
                            das kann mich persönlich nur wenig in
                            teressieren, so lange ich nur die volle
                            Tatsache von allein erlange! Gesetzt
                            der Fall, mein Kopf werde plötzlich
                            abgehauen, nun, dann hat eben ailes
                            aufgehört und die Vorstellung der
                            Weitfchonbeit kommt zu Ende. Diese
                            Behauptung ist kurz aber bündig.
                            Ich hoffe, daß es einmal zur Tat
                            sache wird, daß die Menschen keine Zeit
                            haben werden zu denken, was hinter
                            den Wolken aufgespeichert fei! Ja,
                            wenn ich nicht irre, ist diese Zeit schon
                            bereits da! Denn man tut es heute nur
                            noch nach der Gewohnheit der alten
                            Schablone, daß man sich der Meiha

                            sonst aber tut jeder seine müden Arme

                            eigenen Findens erzeugen. Grund da

                            kungsweise durchblickte, und sich not

                            ihm erst die Sprache als Vermittler

                            Seele zur Menschheit gehörte und von
                            ihr nicht getrennt werden könnte.
                            Daraus erkannte er die Svrachfa

                            mit sie selbst die teleologische Systeme

                            Schicksal selbst schmieden! Eine solche
                            Tatsache wollten und konnten die
                            Wortführer der herrschenden Schablo

                            stark bedroht, und sie wollten sich dort
                            verschanzen. Daraus erklärt sich für
                            uns die Grundlage einer .Kultur, die
                            den menschlichen Geist verkrüppelte,
                            und diese Verkrüppelung für Jahr
                            taufende aufrecht erhielt! Um gegen

                            machen, wendete sich Nietzsche an die
                            freien Geister, und nicht mehr an die.

                            Nun aber öffnet das Tor sich der Zeiten:

                            als nächste Richtung entwickeln können.
                            Das war eine bösverwickelte Sache, die
                            sich nicht fo leicht entwirren ließ! In
                            dieser Richtung und sorgfältigen Aus
                            einandersetzung sollte sich ein jeder mit
                            Behutsamkeit bewegen und rasch erken

                            Sprachform er das gegenwärtige Sy
                            stem in Angriff nehme! Ach! Manch
                            mal hatte ich selbst kaum Zeit, um ei
                            nige Worte zu sagen, und schon
                            brach ein fürchterlicher Sturm aus!
                            Deswegen wählte Nietzsche die aphori
                            stische Form für den Ausdruck feiner
                            Anschauungen! Er mußte nur kleine
                            Andeutungen anwenden, um fo das te
                            leologische System umzuwerten.
                            Auf Grund dieser Tatsache konnte er
                            sich die tooblberechtigte und wissen
                            schaftliche Begründung holen, indem
                            er sich über die unumwundene Herr
                            schaft der einzelnen Person in der
                            Geschichte, die die Menschheit für
                            Jahrtausende führte und verführte,
                            klar wurde! In dieser Erkenntnis
                            erkannte er dann auch rasch, daß wenn
                            schon irgend welche Umänderungen in
                            der Gesellschaft stattfanden die Gesell
                            fchaft mit der Staatsmacht rasch und
                            stets besorgt to at, die ursprüngliche
                            Sache der Teleologie in voller Kraft
                            beizubehalten, aber stets die Formali
                            tätstunst als Vermittlung zu benutzen,
                            um der „plötzlich geförderten" Neuge
                            staltung einen mehr der Modernität
                            entsprechenden Namen beizugesellen!
                            Im Grunde blieb jedoch die alters
                            morsche Geschichte selbst bestehen.
                            Wenn sckon die Geschickte große
                            und weitsichtige Geister ausweist, die
                            ihre Zeit kühn überschauten und gro
                            ße Sehnsucht für neue Kultur em
                            pfangen, fo wußten sie doch, daß ihnen
                            der wissenschaftliche Boden mangelte
                            geqen das ungemein starke System der
                            Teleologie. Deshalb machte Nietzsche
                            nur eine kleine Anspiegelung auf Lu
                            ther und feine Zeit, beleuchtend im
                            Blitzlicht eine» kurzen Aphorismens.
                            Denn Jahrhunderte galten ihm nur
                            als vorbeieilende Minuten! Doch gleich
                            zeigt er an Schopenhauer, wie er _die
                            mangelnde, körnchenweise, willen
                            scbaftliche Untersuchung vollständig be
                            wiesen hatte, und deswegen die Ein

                            tur unmöglich war. Vermittels dieser
                            Einftckt, meinte Nietzsche, wäre es erst
                            möglich, eine vollständige Untersu
                            chung der Weltgeschichte vorzunehmen
                            und zu summieren. Erst mit diesem
                            guten Matertal könne man die Fahne
                            der wissenschaftlichen Aufklärung wei

                            taire! Leider, meinte er, bedürfe es
                            dazu der tapferen Geister, wie ein Vol
                            taire. der offen dem großen König
                            sagte: „Ich ersuche seine Majestät, sich
                            nicht in der Zukunft für mein Nacht
                            quartier zu sorgen!"
                            Das ist genug für die Vorstehenden,
                            und diese sind nur die freien Geister,
                            die es tragen wollen, den äußersten
                            Kamp* gegen das teleologische System
                            auszunehmen, ohne erst vom Staate
                            die nötige Bewilligung für eine Kunst
                            zu erhalten! Hier ist Richard Wagner
                            vollständig mit eingeschlossen! Grund
                            legend handelte es sich hier nur um die
                            offenen Freiherzigen, die sich keiner
                            Empfindsamkeit hingaben, bei einer
                            neuen Kulturgestaltung, und denen ein
                            kleines Vorurteil ihrer abgegrenzten

                            abet übet alles galt!
                            Mit diesem kleinen Seitenblick woll
                            te Nietzsche den freien Geistern zeigen,
                            wie sie sich mit geistigen Massen beweh
                            ren müssen, um die große körnchen

                            arbeit fortzusetzen, und damit die rich
                            tige Stellung dem Staate gegenüber
                            einzunehmen, um nicht beim geringsten
                            Ausspruche zu Nichte gemacht zu wer
                            den! Die war ein guter Wink!
                            Dieser beherzigte Appell fand bei jenen
                            Geistern, welche sich für die Staats
                            politik erklärten, keine Beachtung! Die
                            wahre Einficht mangelte und fo wurde
                            Nietzsche totgeschwiegen. Mögen sich die
                            zukünftigen Geister darüber selbst
                            Klarheit schaffen! Wohlbemerkt, die
                            Einzelnen werden stets die Sünden
                            böcke fein! Das läßt mich die Nietzsche

                            stoßene Wanderer stand vor ihm wie
                            eine Vogelscheuche! Kein Wunder, daß
                            seine Schwester irgend wo bemerkte,
                            die Zarathustra's Gedanken stammen
                            aus den 70er Jahren! In der Tat
                            dachte er, wie er schrieb, viel an die
                            vagabundierenden Wanderer, die das
                            alte Nibelungenlied dichteten und
                            namenlos blieben! Das sind in der
                            Tat die freienGeister! Nach der langen
                            Wanderschaft sehnte sich Nietzsche
                            selbst! Leider vergehen Jtchrzchnte bis
                            sich ein Intellektueller auf solch ei
                            nem Weg wagt! Man möge es bei Tol
                            stoy ersehen, wie lange es dauerte, bis
                            er sick auf die Wanderschaft besann!
                            Bei dem energischen Sprung den
                            Nietzsche machte, ist wohl nicht die
                            große Sorgfalt der freien Geister zu
                            unterschätzen, hauptsächlich wenn
                            wir die Ableitung des teleologischen
                            Systems in das wissenschaftliche
                            Fahrwasser in Betracht ziehen. Auf
                            der einen Seite macht er sie auf diesen
                            Weg aufmerksam, und rät ihnen, sehr
                            vorsichtig zu sein! Daher feilte sich ein
                            Jeder auf eine Kunst werfen, doch nur
                            als ein Mittel zum Zweck, denn die
                            Empfindungen der Meuchen seien
                            noch mit den alteil gewachsenen

                            Why should we subscribe to a Third
                            Liberty Loan?
                            Why should the United States be in
                            the world war at all?
                            Do the people of Germany, and those
                            of the Teutonic alliance generally,

                            What really caused the war? When
                            may the world hope for its ending?

                            partly satisfactory and partly true.
                            If we would really understand the
                            significance of the world war we must

                            of this bloody iniquity. For, mediately
                            or immediately, Germany has been

                            philosophy—a philosophy that bloomed
                            in the blatant blasphemies of
                            Nietzsche and fruited upon the blood

                            This is a philosophy that commends

                            tioning only two or three philosophers
                            of comparatively recent times. These
                            are cited, not so much for what they
                            originated as because they gathered

                            surface of German thought, were des
                            tined to find their ultimate expression
                            in the writings of Frederick Nietzsche.
                            Iniquity knows no fatherland. Hence
                            it need cause no surprise that one of

                            man origin. In Niccolo Machiavelli,
                            an Italian courtier of the Renaissance,
                            appeared the unblushing champion of
                            such brazen intrigue as startled even

                            avowedly unprincipled people. Yet
                            Machiavelli’s precepts, so softened, un

                            least, to break down lingering scrupu

                            the moral law.
                            In Schopenhauer Nietzsche found
                            his earliest master; and, although he
                            parted from him Later on, it is to
                            Schopenhauer, principally, that he owes
                            his characteristic doctrine of the Will
                            to Power. In Schopenheur, it is true,
                            this was merely the Will to Live.
                            Nietzsche carried that doctrine to its
                            logical conclusion—if the Machiavel

                            w, Schopenhauer perceived that the Will
                            llo Live caused evil as well as good—

                            for Nietzsche. His was not the type

                            There was but one logical develop
                            ment for a man of Nietzsche’s type,
                            given such a starting point. He be
                            came the supreme egoist of all ages;
                            and in his blaring egotism crystallized
                            Into definite and coherent propositions
                            all those errant and rebellious eccen
                            tricities which had Characterized Ger
                            man thought. He gave to the Germanic
                            philosophy its full and final expres
                            sion.
                            It was thus that Germany found in
                            Friederich Nietzsche the fitting
                            spokesman for all apostles of brutal
                            ity. He became at once the heir and
                            the administrator of all revolts against
                            delicacy and decency. He was com
                            mitted, absolutely and wholehearted
                            ly, to iconoclasm. These revolutionary
                            tendencies had long sheltered in the
                            shadows of the German universities;
                            and it remained only for later days to
                            bring forth one who might declare
                            them "as one having authority.” In
                            the half-mad, ego-ridden Nietzsche,
                            with his brain of lava and his pen of
                            flame, Germanic philosophy found its
                            spokesman.
                            To other peoples Nietzsche was
                            merely a phenomenon. His writings
                            were to be read and admired for their
                            thunderous and flaming rhetoric. They
                            were not to be accepted literally; they
                            were too subversive of all that civiliza
                            tion stood for. No man, it was felt,
                            could so write of these things and real
                            ly mean exactly what he wrote. A le
                            gion of reviewers swarmed over his
                            books, adapting, construing, interpret
                            ing, each according to his own fancy,
                            the passionate fulminations of this
                            past master of invective.
                            But to Germany, or at least to the
                            leaders of German thought, Nietzsche
                            spake as a prophet. In their ears his
                            scathing doctrines became, not rhet
                            oric, but religion. And his vision of
                            the superman, ruthless, hard, taking
                            without scruple, injuring without
                            qualm, a law unto himself—this was
                            the false god after which Germany
                            went avidly astray.
                            “In our present civilized world,"
                            declared Nietzsche, “we know only the
                            DEGENERATE criminal . . . the
                            criminal who distrusts himself, who
                            often seeks to belittle and excuse his
                            act; and we try to forget that EVERY
                            GREAT MAN WAS A CRIMINAL,
                            only not in miserable style bur in
                            great style. We forget that EVERY
                            [GREAT ACT IS A CRIME.”
                            And so we find our iconoclast, who
                            began with accepting Schopenhauer's
                            harmless Will to Live, evolving the
                            Will to Power. He no longer holds
                            merely that "self-preservation is na
                            ture's first law;” he proclaims that it
                            is right and lawful that he who can
                            shall take whatever he will—provided
                            only that it adds to and does not de
                            tract from his ability to take yet more
                            ruthlessly whatever his neighbor may
                            have that pleases his sovereign fancy.
                            Nietzsche had reached the point where
                            he held himself above the moral law
                            and reversed, or tried to reverse, all
                            accepted standards of right and
                            wrong.
                            Nor did he cease with this; for the
                            prophet, perforce, must justify his
                            prophecy. In the closing chapter of his
                            book. “Der Anti-Christ.” he scaled the
                            very summit of blasphemous presump
                            tion and gave free and final rein to
                            his furious invective. Here lie writes.
                            “1 condemn Christianity. I bring

                            In the last analysis, Nietzsche taught
                            a dual system of morality—a master
                            morality for his beloved superman and
                            a slave morality for the masses who
                            were too impotent, too spiritless or too
                            foolish to make headway against the
                            predatory proclivities of their masters.
                            And in the earlier Hebrew, the man
                            of war and conquest, swarming into a
                            land of milk and honey and making it
                            his own by the edge of his sword
                            putting its men, women and children
                            to a bloody death—he beheld his su
                            perman, with whom God was synony
                            mous with strength, power, beauty,
                            courage, ruthlessness, ferocity, because
                            these things contributed to the exer
                            cise and realization of his Will to
                            x wttci, cixivi xiiin (tuucu gicauxcna
                            and supremacy.
                            But when the Jews were carried into
                            captivity—when they were no longer
                            masters, but slaves—the reversed con
                            ditions of their lot (reasoned Niet
                            ssche) reversed for them the defini
                            tion of God. Resort to the sword bo
                            came, then, the worst thing in the
                            world for them; it meant extermina
                            tion. Unable to combat their masters j
                            with the sword, they resorted to the
                            supreme weapon of the slave (as Niet
                            zsche styles it); they adopted the
                            moral law as their instrument in the
                            irrepressible struggle for supremacy.
                            And thus the characteristics of cowr
                            ardice, timidity, obsequiousness—the
                            marks of the slave—were elevated into
                            virtues. They became love of one’s
                            enemies, obedience to God, meekness
                            of heart; and the suppressed envy,
                            malice and covetousness of these en
                            slaved .people were thus transmuted,
                            through the alchemy of the moral law,
                            into their opposite virtues. Thus in
                            Christianity Nietzsche beheld the su
                            preme triumph of the slave over the
                            truly great and powerful and good.
                            It is characteristic of the Germanic
                            philosophy, however, that in spite of
                            its terrific condemnation of Christian
                            ity it would not abolish this. Niet
                            zsche’s objections to both Christianity
                            and the moral law are based, not upon
                            their intrinsic qualities, but upon the
                            fact that they impose restrictions upon
                            the ruthlessness and aggressiveness of
                            the superman. He would even per
                            petuate Christianity and the moral
                            law, as means of more easily control
                            ling the “slaves.”</text>

                            declare sadly: "I told you so.”
                            That is the view, anyway, of
                            Dr. Erich Heller, distinguished
                            scholar who has made an in
                            tensive study of Nietzsche and
                            his works. Dr. Heller spoke last
                            night in the Library of Con

                            of Nietzsche.” He is professor
                            of German at the University
                            of Wales and the author of
                            several essays on German lit

                            preceding the lecture. Dr. Hel
                            ler said Nietzsche predicted the

                            scientific discoveries.
                            Dr. Heller said Nietzsche
                            doubted man's ability to sur
                            vive the death of God. Man.
                            according to Nietzsche, would
                            lavish material goods upon
                            himself and pull covers over
                            his mind to keep from asking:
                            What am I here for? What
                            is the purpose of life?
                            “The waters of religion re
                            cede and leave behind morasses
                            and shallow pools.” Nietzsche
                            wrote in decrying what would
                            happen once people realized
                            God was dead. “Where we
                            live, soon nobody will be able
                            to exist.”
                            Eventually. Nietzsche be
                            lieved, man would try to create
                            heaven on earth because he
                            would feel there was no heaven
                            beyond the life on earth. Once
                            this happened. Nietzsche pre
                            dicted. man would transfer his
                            religious zeal to an all-out
                            political effort to create this
                            heaven on earth. The ideo
                            logical conflict we are now in,
                            Nietzsche said, would be the
                            result.

                            will be brought to bear to raise
                            the additional revenue called
                            for by the Governor.
                            The Governor contends that i
                            about $9O million in additional
                            revenue is needed to meet
                            essential needs.
                            Yesterday, a House Appro

                            of the Governor’s requests
                            could be dispensed with and
                            that other demands not in

                            tee said, would be to increase
                            the income tax most heavily
                            in the lower salary brackets.
                            The present rate on net tax
                            able income is 2 per cent on |
                            the first $3,000, then 3 per
                            cent on the next $2,000 and 5
                            per cent on all over $5,000. The
                            subcommittee recommended 3
                            per cent of the first $5,000 and

                            wife plus $2OO for each child.
                            Federal exemptions are $6OO
                            for each.
                            Exemptions Curtailed
                            Thus, a childless couple
                            would get a $1,200 exemption
                            compared with $2,000 now al
                            lowed; a couple with one child
                            would get $l,BOO compared
                            with $2,000 at present while a
                            family of four would get the
                            same exemption.
                            Larger families would get
                            greater exemptions than are
                            provided in the present law.
                            The change in the income
                            tax rate and exemptions would
                            give the State $50.7 million in
                            the biennium: a proposed 10

                            According to Dr. Heller.
                            Nietzsche believed "the time is
                            fast approaching when secular

                            the world with their rival claims
                            to compensate for the lost
                            Kingdom of Heaven by setting
                            up on earth the idealogical rules
                            of love and justice which, by the

                                    <text>Fredrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, born October 15,
                            1844, was the son of the pastor of the church at
                            Iloecken, Saxony. He took his university course
                            at Ilonn and Leipsic, making a specialty of the
                            classics. His ability was so marked that he re
                            ceived appointment as professor-extraordinary in
                            Classical Philology at Basel while he was yet an
                            undergraduate. He resigned this chair in 1880
                            because of 'll health. After leaving his professor
                            ship, he traveled some and continued his literary
                            activity until 1S89, when he became insane. This
                            mental eclipse shadowed him until his death in
                            1900.
                            His first work, The Birth of Tragedy, appeared
                            in 187 2. It was the production of a literary
                            genius, but it attracted little attention. Follow
                            ing this he gave five other books to the world, and
                            the world scarce heeded the gift. His literary
                            activity extended over barely«seventeen years, and
                            he waited eleven of those years before he obtained
                            a noteworthy number of readers. The first of
                            his works that 'gained the attention which the
                            finish and richness of his style and the force and
                            audacity of his thought demanded, was Thus
                            Spake Zarathustra. The first part of this work
                            was published in 1883; three other parts appeared
                            later, but it was never completed. The Nietzschean
                            books of principal interest for our study which
                            were published after Thus Spake Zarathustra are
                            Beyond Good and Evil, the Genealogy of Morals,
                            The Transvaluation of Values, and The Will to
                            Power. The last, a post-humous work published
                            in 1901, expresses in its title what was distinctive
                            of Ins Philosophy.
                            Nietzsche was first of all an ardent student of
                            the classics and a literary genius of high rank.
                            The German language is generally accounted in
                            elastic and unwieldy, but it was resilient to his
                            touch and quickly respondent to his moods. His
                            temperament and vision were poetical rather
                            than philosophical; nevertheless the history of
                            literature and reflective thought places him with
                            philosophers. And this, although he did not de
                            velop a system of philosophy nor subject any one
                            of the problems of philosophy to systematic treat
                            ment. Ilis writings are not shaped after the pat
                            tern peculiar to philosophical works. They are
                            aphoristic and paragraphic, and the logical con
                            nection is not always discoverable. Thus Spake
                            Zarathustra is allegorical and Oriental, not dialec
                            tic and Western. Ilis thought is not ratiocinative
                            and impassive, but assertive and intense; it is not
                            expressed in unmetaphoric form, but is often rich
                            ly tropical.
                            As a consequence of his epigrammatic thought
                            ;. d his hearty disdain of those who may differ
                            from him, he is extreme in statement. These
                            qualities give a captivating vividness to his style;
                            but they make interpretation difficult. This dif
                            ficulty is increased by the fact that he has appar
                            ently no care to preserve consistency. In many
                            places he decries the feeling of pity; but against
                            this, in The Will to Power, he says; "Pity for the
                            humble and suffering is the measure of the soul’s
                            elevation.” The interpretation of Nietzsche of
                            fered in this paper is, I believe, logically deducible
                            from his fundamental principle; and it can be
                            sustained by quotations from his writings and ac
                            cords with the interpretation given by those who
                            accept his philosophy.
                            As ordinarily conceived Philosophy sets highest
                            value on truth; truth is for it another name for
                            the reality of all that is. It is the longing for
                            truth that sets it upon search for the norms of in
                            tellectual, ethical and aesthetic validity. These
                            norms are the expression of reality. In its search,
                            Philosophy submits itself to the rule of ration
                            ality—not merely intellective, but also affective
                            and volitional. Nietzsche makes vehement protest
                            against Philosophy thus conceived.
                            Unreflective human activity ranks higher with
                            him than reasoned activity; he insists that instinct
                            is by right lord over reason. All good is instinct,
                            is a principle of his philosophy. According to
                            him the will is “the sum total of a man's in
                            stincts,” and “strong will is the orientation of
                            instincts.” lie protests also that there is no fixed
                            reality to be sought. There is no world of doers,
                            only a world of action. He says: “The ‘doer’ Is
                            merely a fictitious addition to the doing; the
                            doing is all.” He likewise objects to the assump
                            tion that we should be guided by the Will to
                            Truth. He writes thus: “Granted that we want
                            ed the truth: why not rather untruth? And un
                            certainty? Even ignorance?” Again, he character
                            izes the notion that illusion is less valuable than
                            truth, as a “kind of silliness;” and he says that he
                            is "fundamentally inclined to maintain that the
                            falsest opinions.are the most indispensable
                            to us,” and that, “the renunciation of them would
                            be ... . a negation of life.”</text>

                            of comparatively recent times. These
                            are cited, not so much for what they
                            originated as because they gathered

                            an Italian courtier of the Renaissance
                            appeared the unblushing champion ol

                            for Nietzsche. His was not the type

                            from him as to the conclusions to be
                            drawn therefrom. He held, on the con- (

                            rate true heroism, lay in stiff-necked
                            indifference toward all "tho ills that

                            shadows of the German universities;
                            and it remained only for later days tc

                            the half-mad, ego-ridden Nietzsche,

                            flame, Germanic philosophy found its
                            spokesman. j
                            To other peoples Nietzsche was
                            merely a phenomenon. Ills writings
                            were to be read and admired for their
                            thundering and flaming rhetoric. They
                            were not to be accepted literally; they
                            were too subversive of all that civiliza
                            tion stood for. No man, it was felt,
                            could so write of these things and real

                            legion of reviewers swarmed over his
                            bonks, adapting, construing, interpret

                            But to Germany, or at least to the
                            leaders of German thought, Nietzsche
                            spa'ne as a prophet. In their ears his

                            Nietzsche had reached the point where
                            he held himself above the moral law
                            and revejwul, or tried to reverse, all
                            accepted standards of right and
                            wrong.
                            Nor did he cease with this; for the

                            the origin of morality, as taught by
                            Jewish history. Is one of the most,
                            characteristically Nietzschean of all
                            that he has written.
                            In the last analysis, Nietzsche taught
                            a dual system of morality a master
                            morality for his beloved superman and
                            a slave morality for the masses who
                            were too impotent, too spiritless or
                            too foolish to make headway against
                            the predatory proclivities of their mas
                            ters. And in the earlier Hebrew, the
                            wan of war and conquest, swarming
                            into a laud of milk and honey and
                            making it hi3 own by the edge of his
                            sword putting Its men, women and
                            children to a bloody death he beheld
                            his superman, for whom God' was
                            synonymous with strength, power,
                            beauty, courage, ruthlessness, ferocity,
                            because these things contributed to
                            the exercise nnd realization of his Will
                            to Power, and gave him added great-'
                            ness and supremacy.- j
                            But when the Jews were carried into
                            captivity when they were no longer
                            masters, but slaves the reversed con
                            ditions of their lot (reasoned Niet
                            zsche) reversed for them the defini
                            tion of God. Resort to the sword be
                            came, then, the worst thing in the
                            world for them; it meant extermina
                            tion. Unable to combat their masters
                            wth the.sword, they resorted to the su
                            preme weapon of the slave (as Niet
                            zsche styles it); they adopted the
                            moral law as their instrument in the
                            irrepressible struggle for supremacy.
                            And thus the characteristics of cow-
                            ardice, timidity, obsequiousness the
                            marks of the slave were elevated into
                            virtues. They became love of one's
                            enemies, obedience to God, meekness
                            of heart; and the suppressed envy,
                            malice and covetousness of these en
                            slaved people were thus transmuted,
                            through the alchemy of the moral law
                            into their opposite virtues. Thus in
                            Christianity Nietzsche beheld the su
                            preme triumph of the slave over the
                            truly great and powerful and good.
                            It is characteristic of the Germanic
                            philosophy, however, that in spite ol
                            its terrific condemnation of Christian
                            ity it would not abolish this. Niet
                            zsche's objections to both Christianity
                            and the moral law are based, not upon
                            their intrinsic qualities, but upon the
                            fact that they impose restrictions upon
                            the ruthlessness and aggressiveness of
                            the superman. He would even per
                            petuate Christianity and the moral
                            law, as means of more easily control
