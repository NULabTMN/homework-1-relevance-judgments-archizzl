          <text>Philadelphia, Nov. 18 – Following the death of R.H. Holmes, also known as Howard, in Boston, a major insurance fraud scheme has been uncovered by detectives from the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Association.

            On September 3, a man's body was found at 1319 Callowhill Street in Philadelphia and was initially identified by the coroner as H.J. Pitezel. However, it has now come to light that this body was a substitute used in a plot to defraud the insurance company of $10,000.

            Attorney Howe, from St. Louis, appeared in Philadelphia with a young girl, claiming she was the daughter of the deceased. The insurance company, after exhuming the body to confirm its identity, was satisfied with the claim and reburied it. Attorney Howe then collected $10,000, the amount owed to Mrs. Pitezel.

            A month ago, an agent from the insurance company, while in St. Louis, learned key information that revealed a conspiracy. It turns out that Holmes and Pitezel had a relationship as lawyer and client. Holmes had been previously arrested under the alias H.M. Howard for obtaining goods under false pretenses. Further investigation showed that Holmes and Pitezel had worked together in Chicago during the World’s Fair, running a hotel where they used secret rooms to hide goods they had swindled from merchants. This hotel was called the “World’s Fair Hotel.”

            During this time, Pitezel took out an insurance policy with the Fidelity company, and Holmes followed suit a month later, both using promissory notes for the first payment. After some investigation, it was discovered that Holmes and Pitezel obtained a corpse from a New York hospital, brought it to Philadelphia, staged the death at the Callowhill Street house, and collected the $10,000 payout. Holmes was arrested in Boston, and detectives are now pursuing the other conspirators involved.</text>

          Story —Lawyer Uowe
          Missing.
          By the Associated Press,
          Philadelphia, Nov. 20.—Tbe arch
          conspirator, H. H. Holmes, accompa
          nied by Mrs. Pitzel and a pretty woman
          who calls herself Mrs. Holmes, arrived
          in this city today in the custody of De
          tective Crawford and Special Agent Perry
          •of the Fidelity Mutual Life association.
          Mrs. Piizel's 16 year old daughter, Meda,
          and her 1-year-old bay were also with
          the party. Mrs. Holmes disappeared
          soon after her arrival, and no clue to her
          whereabouts could be obtained. It is
          thought she is stopping at a hotel in the
          neighborhood of police headquarters.
          After tbe arrival, tbe party was
          closeted with Superintendent of Police
          Linden until late in the afternoon.
          When the conference was over. Detective
          Crawford detailed the story of tbe trip,
          tbe moat important feature of which
          was the relation by Mr. Holmes of the
          story of bis whole life. It reads like
          tbe moat sensational of romances.
          Holmes Bat beside tbe detective with
          handcuffs on. The train had scarcely
          emerged from the Boston depot before
          lie iried to bribe hie captor. He offered
          the detective $000 if ho would allow him
          to escape. He said he had frequently
          hypnotized persons, having acquired the
          r.rt from a coliege professor in the west.
          He said he could get the money from
          his wife or Mrs. Pitzel. Wben ho caw
          his words had no effect, he entered into
          general conversation aud told the story
          of hia life.
          He said he was raised in Burlington,
          Vermont, and was co well educated in
          the schools that at 15 he was a tencher.
          For some time afterward he went to
          collegia there and later in Detroit, Micb.
          Here he formed the acquaintance of a
          medical student, who, he said, fur
          nished the body in New York in the
          present caee. He refused to divulge
          hie name. During vacations tbey wonted
          on farrae to ruiee their college expeuees.
          but one summer tbey found theuiGelves
          without means, and then the medical
          man suggested the idea of getting a
          body and beating nn insurance com
          pany. This was 12 years ago.
          The doctor got his life insured for
          $12,000. They obtained a body in Chi
          cago, took it east, arranged the details
          id identification and successfully got !
          the money with which they continued j
          their studies. He refused to name the -
          company thus swindled. They worked
          the scheme afterwards with sncceis,
          obtaining sums ranging from $10 000 to
          $20,000.
          j Once Holmes got bis life insured for
          [ $20,000 He then went to a hotel in
          Rhode Inland. At that time be wore a
          beard. He secured a corpse in Chicago,
          cut off the head and took tbo body to a
          lonely spot not far from tbe hotel.' Then
          he ehaved off his beard, returned to the
          hotel, asked for Holrr.es and engaged a
          room to wait for him. He bad brought
          the head with him and burned it be
          yond recognition in the fireplace of the
          hotel. This scheme, however, fell
          through, the mother of big wife, when
          she discovered the scheme, threatening
          to tell tbe police, and Holmes fled to
          the west.
          Resuming his story he said that while
          living in Chicago about 18 months ago,
          he tell in with a type-writer girl and
          furnished a house on the outskirts
          where tbey lived together. A younger
          sister came to visit them and the
          woman grew so jealous of her that in a
          quarrel one day she struck her over
          the head with a etool and killed her.
          To save the woman with whom he
          lived, Holmes said he put the body in
          a trunk loaded with stones and sunk
          it in the lake.
          This girl had property in Texas, and
          he and Pitzel took it off her hands and
          sent her abroad. It waa worth, he said,
          $40,000, and after getting it in their
          hands they went through Texas buying
          carloads of horses on notes on this prop
          erty, but as they never had a legal title
          to the property, the notes were worth
          less, and it is for this affair they are
          wanted in Fort Worth. To save this
          property Holmes said he and Pitzel
          formed tbo scheme of swindling the Fi
          delity company. He told the detective
          that for the crimes he had committed
          he deßerved to be hanged a dozen
          times.
          Holmes is not lacking for money, as
          he himself admitted that at the present
          time he ih supporting nearly two dozen
          persons, including the girl murderess,
          her mother and an imbecile brother,
          two orphans in Chicago who live in one
          of his properties, three separate alleged
          wiveß and their children rtnd his own
          mother and father in Kankakee. He
          would not give the names of the women.
          He firmly maintained that Pitzel ie
          alive and in Snn Salvador, and that he
          will hear from him through the personal
          column of a certain newepaper,
          Mr. Ferry said that ac a result of the
          interview it had been decided to arrest
          a number of other persona whose names
          were not ready to be given out.
          Mr. Perry related in detail the story
          of Holmes' arrest in Boston and the
          manner in which Mrs. Pitzel was de
          coyed from Burlington. He said tbat in
          the secret conference today nothing had
          been said that would in tbe slightest
          degree refute his original theory that
          Pitzel had been murdered. Wben in
          the west be saw tbe parents of Mrs.
          Pitzel, and tbey told him their daugh
          ter had complained of the exorbitant
          fee charged by the St. Loniß lawyer—
          $2500. In corroboration of his murder
          theory, Mr. Perry said tbat he had from
          Mrs. Pitzel an exact description of
          her husband, agreeing in every respect
          with that of the corpse found in the
          Oallowhill street hoose. Mrs, Pitzel, he
          continued, was perfectly innocent of
          any complicity in the whole affair. She
          told Perry last night that she had re
          ceived only $5000 in cash. She said
          Holmeß had taken $5000 of the money
          and put it in a speculation in Port
          Worth in which Pitz9l was also Inter
          ested. Holmes told Perry that this was
          true. In Texas, Perry said, Holmes
          operated under the name of H. H.
          Pratt. He added that Pitzel and B. T.
          Lyman are one and tbe same man.
          MRS. PITZEL'S STORY.
          Hho Fairs Bar Hmliiud Is Really Dead.
          M-r Daughter Missing.
          Boston. Nov. 20.—Mrs. Carrie Pitiel,
          it is claimed, has made a full confession
          of the alleged insurance swindle. It is
          stated that she hae implicated Holmeß,
          at whose suggestion, it is claimed, she
          went to Burlington, Vt. She stated
          that Holmee substituted tbe alleged
          bogus body for that of her husband and
          collected the insurance, but she was
          kept in ignorance of the whereabouts
          of her husband, who disappeared at
          once. Since the affair she has been
          roaming round from place to place,
          prompted by Holmee, in eearcti of her
          hueband, and it waa through the hope
          that she would be sent to him that Bhe
          answered the telegrams of the detec
          tives. Now ahe fears that the body for
          which the insurance was paid was not a
          bogus one, but that of her hnsband.
          Mrs. Pitzel aleo fears that her daugh
          ter, Alice, who was the only one besides
          Holmes t > identify tha body, has been
          spirited away, as Bhe has completely
          disappeared and Holmes is the last one
          known to have seen her. Holmes as
          serts be left Alice and tbe other Pitzel
          children at their father's home in
          Detroit a month ago, and since then has
          heard nothing from him.
          Holmee further stand that wben he
          came to Boston on 'Tuesday last be in
          tended to take paesage for Berlin, but
          changed his mind, and before he could
          perfect other plana the detectives bad
          him.
          HOLMES' VICTIMS.
          Good Reason to Believe He Murdered
          tbe Williams Sisters.
          Fort Worth, Tex., Nov. 20.—There is
          every reason to bolieve that C. H.
          Holmee, who went by tbe name of O. C.
          Pratt in Fort Worth, ia guilty of mur
          dering Minnie X, Wiliiame und her sis
          ter Ann. The crime waa probably com
          mitted in Chicago, and in this crime a
          man who claimed here to be a
          citizen of Chicago and called himself
          Benton T. Lyman, is an accomplice,
          Some time iv February be came here
          from Chicago and placed on record a
          deed from one Bond to Lyman for ICO
          feet front on Husk und Second etreete.
          Bond got title by deed from Minnie
          R. Wiliiame, executed before a no
          tary, whoan name was said to be
          HolmeD. Oa this property Lyman
          beaaii the erection of a three-story
          huilding. Lyman had sold one lot to a
          Fort Worth citizen who, fearing the title
          wae clouded, began to invest gate. He
          found that Minnie R. Wiliiame wrote
          late in 1803 to her sister Miss Ann Wil
          ium*, of Midlothian, Texas, to come to
          Chicago, tnat she v. a a going to bs mar
          ried and go to Europo. The sister left
          for Chicago. No word ever came from
          either of tbe Bistere.
          Minnie K. Williams, by will, was left
          half a block of property in tbe heart of
          Fort Worth, valued at $60,000, and a
          farm valued at $15,000. Thiß property
          has all been alienated, ostensibly by
          Miss Wiliiame. A detective has recent
          ly been sent to find the girls, but no
          trace can be discovered.

            Third Woman Victim
            Discovered.
            By the Associated Press,
            Philadelphia, Nov. 21. —The Pitzel
            mystery deepens as time wears on. To
            day many theories in regard to the mys
            tery were knocked in the head by tbe
            announcement tbat 13. F. Pitzel, the
            supposed murdered man, was seen in
            Chicago less than two weeks ago. Pres
            ident Fouzof the Fidelity Life Insurance
            company said today:
            "This morning my Chicago represen
            tative telegraphed me tbat a Mr. Bryan,
            who is a bueiness man in Chicago, called
            on him and said that B. F. Pitzel was
            in tbat city less than two weeke ago.
            Mr. Bryan says be bas known Pitzel for
            many years, and had frequent business
            transactions with him, and it is impos
            sible fot him to be mietaken. When
            they met, Bryan did not know Pitzel
            wae euppoeed to be dead, and tbe two
            greeted each otber cordially and re
            paired to a near-by ealoon where they
            bad a drink together. Then tbey sep
            arated and Bryant saye he doee not
            know whether Pitzel was to remain in
            thecity or not. However, our men there
            and tbe Pinkerton detectives have taken
            up the clew, and it is my opinion that
            Pitzel will be produced within a few
            dayp."
            President Fcuz called on Mrs. Pitzel
            and her daughter at tbe Central station,
            tiday, and received valuable informa
            tion Irom tbe daughter in reference to
            her father. The daughter said she re
            numbered while walking with her fa
            ther one Sunday in Chicago that tbat
            latter bad said to her: "If you ever hear
            through the newspapers or any otber
            way tbat I iiave been found dead, do not
            believe it. I will be all right."
            Later on, while in Boson, she read
            the story ot her father's death in a news
            paper. As soon as she had finished the
            etory, Holmes said to her: "Do you re
            member what your father told you the
            afternoon you were walking in Chi
            cago?"
            Daring Mr. Fouz'e interview with the
            daughter, Mrs. Pilzal grew excited and
            exclaimed : "They have all deceived me,
            even my own daughter."
            Mrs. Pitzsl said she remembered re
            ceiving a letter from her daughter Alice
            in which she related her experience
            while coming east for the purpose of
            identifying her father's body. Alice
            etated that Howe and Holmes accom
            panied her and both were sociable with
            each otber on the trip east. This eets
            at reet the claim of Howe that be never
            met Holmes until introduced to him by
            President Fouz on hia arrival in this
            city.

            ANOTHER WOMAN VICTIM.
            Chicago, Nov. 21. —Following cloae on
            tbe atory of tbe mysterious disappear
            ance of the Wiliiame aiatera at tbe hands
            of Holmee, tbe life inenrance swindler,
            comes a (iiird woman victim, namely
            Miss Kate Durkee. Miss Durkee had
            property. Documents representing the
            property came into the bands of H. H.
            Holmes by theft. The woman mysteri
            ously disappeared, and Holmes showed
            title to the property. Mies Durkee was
            not Miss Williams; she bad dark eyes
            aud hair, while Miss Williams waa a
            blonde. A year ago today 25 creditors
            oi H. H. Holmes met at tbe office of
            George B. Chamberlain and made a des
            perate effort to find out who and where
            Miss Durkee was. It waa supposed she
            was an accomplice of Holmes; tbat
            property, illegally obtained waa being
            trauaferred to her name. Tbe creditors
            wished to reach it. Suddenly Kate Dur
            kee dropped entirely from sight, like
            tbe Williams sisters, and left no trace
            behind.
            "I believe she waa murdered," said
            Chamberlain today. "I believe also
            tbat both Williams girls wore mur
            dered."
            Mr. Chamberlain, as proprietor of the
            Lafayette Mercantile agency, began an
            investigation of Holmee a year ago.

            this city witb ber brother, who is
            assistant auditor of tbe Burlington rail
            road. She expreeeed aurpriee wben
            asked concerning ber connection with
            Holmes' family in Chicago. She never
            heard of but one wife. Hie recently
            visited Mrs. Holraea and made Holmee
            transfer a piece of property in Chicago for
            ber. She refused to explain what prop
            erty this was, hut declared that Holmes'
            Chicago lawyer was familiar with the
            deal.
            Attorney Duncombe of this city said:
            "Holmes employed me to attend to
            some business for him, and in the courae
            of the action for which I waa retained it
            became necessary to take the deposition
            of Miss Kate Durkee. In her evidence
            she eaid she waa related to the wife of
            Holmeß."
            Mr. Duncombe said he had frequently
            seen Pitzel in company with Holmes
            and that ho would know whether ttie

          <text>Bodies of the Murdered
            Pietzel Girls Found
            in Toronto.
            THREE FIENDISH CRIMES.
            The Notorious H. H. Holmes
            Accused of Taking Their
            Lives.
            RECORD OF MANY KILLINGS.
            It Is Thought the Insurance Swin
            dler Had Murdered the Elder
            Pietzel.
            TORONTO, Ont., July 15.— The bodies
            of Etta, Alice and Hettie Pietzel, the miss
            ing daughters of Benjamin F. Pietzel,
            were found by Detective Cuddy of Toronto
            and Detective Greyer of Philadelphia, to
            day, buried in the cellar of the house
            No. 16 St. Vincent street. H. H. Holmes,
            now under arrest at Philadelphia, is be
            lieved to have deliberately murdered the
            girls after he had first murdered their
            father in Philadelphia and their brother in
            Detroit.
            Inquiries began by the police to-day and
            led to the knowledge that Holmes and the
            children lived at the house in question,
            and search was made by the two ottioers.
            A photograph of Holmes was shown to
            Frank N. Nudel of the Ontario Educational
            Department, who owns No. 16 St. Vincent
            street, and without hesitation he identified
            it as that of the man who had rented the
            house from him last October, and after a
            very short stay had departed.
            When they reached the cellar it appeared
            to the detectives that something had dis
            turbed the cellar floor, and arming them
            selves with shovels they began to dig. A
            short distance below the surface they came
            across the arm and a portion at the head of
            one of the girls, and further work soon re
            vealed the bodies of all of the victims.
            They were nude and apparently had lain
            there since last October.
            City Detective Inspector Stark was com
            municated with and gave instructions that
            the bodies be removed, and they were
            taken to Humphrey's undertaking estab
            lishment on Yonge street. Coroner Orr
            was informed of the ghastly discovery, and
            called an inquest to be held at Police
            Headquarters to-morrow night. It is un
            derstood that the jury will meet pro forma,
            and after viewing the bodies will adjourn
            for one week, to enable the Crown authori
            ties to work up evidence. The bodies of
            the little ones were buried three feet from
            the surface and were in a fair state of
            preservation.
            Holmes, the alleged murderer of the
            girls, is held in Philadelphia on a charge
            of conspiracy, and a nice legal point now
            presents itself. The murders have been
            committed in Canada, the accused
            must be tried within its boundaries, but
            as Holmes has pleaded guilty to one
            charge in the United States he may insist
            on being sentenced for that.
            H. H. Holmes, alias Harwam W. Mudg
            ett, alias H. H. Howard, was born in New
            Haven, Conn., and attended a medical
            school at Burlington, Vt.,and later at Ann
            Arbor, Mich. He was married at the
            latter place. He and a friend swindled an
            insurance company in Chicago om of
            $12,000 soon after graduating. They made
            another haul of $10,000 in a similar way.
            Holmes went into the drug business and
            speculated. His wife went home and he
            married another woman, with whom he
            went to California.
            Returning about a year ago, he went to
            housekeeping with the woman typewriter
            of the company, whose acquaintance he
            had formed. He tried to cheat a fire insur
            ance company out of $00,000, but failed,
            and learning that his typewriter and her
            sister had inherited $50,000 laid a scheme
            to ket the money. The sister came to live
            with them and suddenly disappeared,
            while he and Minnie, the typewriter girl,
            took up their abode at the Plaza Hotel,
            Chicago.
            Holmes next appeared in Terre Haute,
            Ind., where he bailed Pietzel out of jail.
            From there he went to Franklin, Ind.,
            where he married Miss Yoke, and they
            spent their honeymoon in Denver, where
            Holmes made $27,000 in speculation.
            At Philadelphia, later on, he and Fietzel
            played the last card. Pietzel wu insured
            in the Philadelphia Mutual for $10,000.
            On September 3 he was found dead in the
            house at 1316 Callowhill street, which he
            had rented under the name of B. F. Perry.
            His body was badly burned and the face
            was almost unrecognizable. Holmes and
            Pietzel's wife's children identified the body
            as Pietzel's, and $7500 of the insurance was
            paid over.
            Then Train-robber Hedgespeth gave the
            whole case away to Chief of Police Harri
            son because Lawyer Howe, whom he had
            got into the conspiracy, had not paid
            him the promised reward. Holmes was
            traced to Toronto, Burlington and Boston,
            and in the latter city was arrested. Mean
            while the Pietzel children haa disappeared,
            the boy being traced to Indianapolis and
            two girls to Toronto. Holmes awaits
            sentence in Philadelphia for insurance
            fraud, and the police expect to fix several
            murders on him.
            Doctors who have examined the bodies
            agree with Detective Grier's theory that
            the girls were killed by hypodermic injec
            tions of morphine. Holmes is known to
            be an expert user of injections. J

            PHILADELPHIA, Pa., July With
            the finding of the bodies of the Pietzel
            children in Toronto, a chapter in the his
            tory of one of the most sensational crim
            inal cases in the annals of this country is
            closed, and the net of the law is being
            drawn more closely " about one of
            the : boldest scoundrels . who have ever
            been arraigned at the bar of justice.
            Herman Mudgett. alias H. H. Holmes, is
            in the County Prison here awaiting sen
            tence to the confessed charge of conspiracy
            in defrauding the Fidelity Life Association
            of Philadelphia. out of $10,000 by palm
            ing off upon it a bogus body
            as that of Benjamin F. Pietzel, , a
            policy-holder of the company. The case
            exceeds in interest the most sensational
            novel ever written, and has so many sides
            to it that it ts difficult to even outline it in
            the ordinary length of a newspaper dis
            patch. ■;:
            ■ In July, 1889, tne Fidelity Life Associa
            tion issued a policy for $10,000 upon the
            life of Benjamin Pietzel. Shortly after
            this, a man giving the name of B. A.
            Perry rented a house at 1319 Cailowhill
            street, this city. In September of the
            same year a lire, shown to have been
            caused by an explosion, occurred at the
            house and the charred body of Perry was
            found.
            A short time after this Jephtha B.Howe,
            an attorney at St. Louis, presented a claim
            to the Fidelity Company for the $10,000 on
            the life of Pietzel, alleging that the man
            found in the house at 1319 Callow
            hill was Pietzel. With Howe were
            Alice, the 13-year-old daughter of Pietzel,
            and Holmes, the arch conspirator in the
            case. The body of the supposed Perry had
            beenburied in the potter's field, but was ex
            humed, and Alice and Holmes positively
            identified it as that of Pietzel. The money
            was paid to Howe and the party returned
            to St. Louis.
            Mrs. Pieteel was in St. Louis at this
            tini-', and through the representations of
            Holmes that she could aid her husband in
            furthering his interests, had consented to
            become a party to Holmes' scheme to de
            ceive the insurance company by passing
            off upon it a bogus body as that of Pietzel.
            Holmes told her that he and Pietzel had
            procured a corpse in New York and had
            had it up in the house at 1319 Cailowhill
            street and that this was the body found.
            Mrs. Pietzel believed this story, and to aid
            her husband consented to take part in the
            deception.
            The insurance company became sus
            picious, and setting detectives upon
            Holmes' track built up a case against him,
            and in November last year Holmes was
            arrested in Boston.
            A few days after Holmes' arrest Mrs.
            Pietzel was arrested in the same city and
            Howe was arrested in St. Louis. Holmes
            offered to relieve her of the burden
            of the three children. The oldest and
            the youngest child remained with Mrs.
            Pietzel and Holmes took the other three.
            Alice, Nettie and Howard. After parting
            with her children, Mrs. Pietzel has never
            been able to obtain from Holmes any defi
            nite Knowledge of their whereabouts.

            Hair Found in a Bed of
            Clay.
            CHICAGO, July 27. — More con
            clusive evidence than has heretofore
            been collected by the police in the
            Holmes case was revealed by the
            investigation tonight. Inspector
            Fitzpatrick believes it to be certain
            that at least three murders were
            committed in the "castle" of Holmes,
            and through witnesses that were
            found today it is believed Holmes
            can now be convicted of murder in
            this city. The police have found a
            man, whose name they refuse to di
            vulge, but who was brought to the
            office of the inspector this afternoon
            by Lieut. Thomas and Officer Foley,
            of the Cottage Grove avenue sta
            tion. He told the police that he had
            mounted three skeletons for Holmes,
            and that the skeletons were from
            bodies taken from the house of
            Holmes on Sixty-third street. One
            of these he said was the body of a
            man, and the other two were wom
            en. They were taken from a dark
            room in Holmes' house in the night
            time, and two of the mounted skel
            etons were returned to Holmes. The
            flesh of the bodies had not been
            stripped from the bones when the
            bodies were given to the new wit
            ness, but the faces were so badly
            lacerated and torn that identifica
            tion would have been impossible.
            The police also found an expressman
            today who was able to give what the
            police think is important informa
            tion. The name of the expressman
            is Charles Humphrey, and in the
            month of June, 1893, he was hired
            by Holmes to deliver a box and a
            trunk at the union depot in this
            city. The box, according to Humph
            rey, was taken from a dark room
            and had the appearance of a coffin
            box. This was expressed to Phila
            delphia, while the trunk was sent
            in another direction.
            GHASTLY DETAILS.
            The story of the man who mount
            ed the skeletons is to the effect that
            in June, 1593, he was sent for by
            Holmes, who at that time was go
            ing under the alias of Gordon, and
            asked if he would articulate the
            skeleton of a man whose body was
            in the possession of Holmes. He ac
            cepted the job, and by the direction
            of Holmes he called at the house on ;
            a stipulated night. He was taken !
            by Holmes to a room which would
            have been dark even in the day
            time. Stretched out on a table in
            the middle of the room was the body
            of a man. The skin was entirely re
            moved from the face, but in all other
            respects it .*■ was in good condition.
            The articulator and Holmes had
            some talk as to the best way of get
            ting the body out of the house, as
            Holmes said he did not want the
            neighbors to see it removed. It was
            finally agreed that the articulator
            should cut off the, arms, and that
            Holmes would provide for the re- '
            moval of the rest of the ■. corpse, j
            This was done, and the articulator I
            left the house carrying the arms ;
            with him in a sack. He had just
            reached his house, and was prepar
            ing to go to bed, when ,he was
            called to the front door by a loud
            knocking. He went down and
            found Holmes and another man
            there. They had the balance of the
            body, which had been cut into two
            more pieces after, the articulator
            left the house. Holmes left, after !
            remarking that he would have an-

            other job for the man in a short
            time. True to his word, in Decem
            ber he sent for the articulator a sec
            ond time, and on the arrival of the
            latter at the house of Holmes he
            was taken to the same dark room,
            where en the same table where the
            body of a man had 'lain on the oc
            casion of his former visit, was the
            body of a young woman. The face
            of this corpse had been disfigured
            in such a manner that it was im
            possible to tell what she had looked
            like when alive. Y^YYY.Y

            I the effect that he was hired by r
            Holmes one afternoon, and told not ;
            ito come to the house until after
            i nightfall. When the expressman
            ! kept his appointment he was given
            a box and a trunk by Holmes and i
            told to take them to the union depot. i
            When he was putting the box into
            the wagon he turned it on end, and i
            I was at once stopped by Holmes, who j
            told him that he was on no account i
            to keep the box in any other posi- I
            j tion except flat on the side. The or- i
            ders were to take the trunk and box I
            • to the depot and leave them on I
            the platform, and he was told that j
            they would be taken care of. He !
            saw only one man at the depot who
            seemed to be interested in the trunk I
            and the box. After Humphrey had
            told his story to the police tonight, j
            Pat Quinlan was brought up from j
            his cell and the two were placed
            face to face. The police will not j
            tell why this was done, but the
            general opinion is that it was done
            because Humphrey recognized Quin
            lan as the man at the depot. The
            expressman will be retained in cus
            ! tody as a witness.
            HIS THIRD TRIP.
            J In January, 1893, the articulator was
            I sent for a third time by Holmes, and in
            i the same room and on the same table
            j he found the body of a second young
            i woman, from whose face all the skin
            j had been removed. The articulator
            ! had this body taken to his home, where
            j he stopped the bones and mounted the
            i skelton. When he called on Holmes
            i for his pay the latter refused to give it
            i to him, and was, moreover, somewhat
            J in arrears on the bill for mounting the
            two previous skeltons. The two men
            could not come to terms and the dis
            pute finally ended by the articulator
            j retaining possession of the third skel
            ton, and he still has it it in his house.
            j He removed the skull tonight and
            brought it to the central police station,
            I where It now Is. The articulator will
            be kept under close surveillance for
            j some days yet, as the police do not
            I think that he has told them all he
            I knows about the murder in the "cas-
            I tie." He said at first that Holmes
            j called at his house under the name of
            i Gordon, and later said that he be
            j came acquainted with Holmes through I
            j answering an advertisement for a man j
            I capable In the work of articulating
            j skeletons, and found that the advertise-
            S ment had been inserted by Holmes,
            j Afterwards he let drop some expres
            , sions that showed that he had done
            j some work for Holmes prior to the time j
            ' that he claimed his acquaintance with
            i him began. This discrepancy in his
            j story decided the police to keep a close
            . watch on him. The police declare that
            ! they have almost positive proof that
            J the first female body was that of
            I Emeline Cigrand and the second that of
            Annie Williams. It is the skull of
            . Annie Williams that is now at the
            central police station.
            J BURIED IN QUICKLIME.
            In prosecuting the investigation of
            j the basement of the big brick house on
            j Sixty-third street today the workmen
            employed by the police came upon two
            graves. The indications are that in
            | the graves were laid the bodies of Mm
            J nic and Annie Williams. Lime and
            j quicklime had accomplished their work
            j and the bodies had turned to native |
            dust, but there still remained sufficient
            evidence to make the indentificati.on
            possible. Two soft spots in a bed of |
            hard clay were the size of human bod- j
            ies, and where the heads would have I
            been were mats of long hair. One big
            strand was of light color, like that of
            Annie, while the other was of the'
            brown hue of Minnie's hair. '
            The juxtaposition of the mats of
            hair would indicate that the bodies
            had been laid side by side, the heads
            but a few inches apart. Twelve men I
            worked with picks and shovels in the !
            I rear basement of the "castle" today. '
            ) They were divided into two squads, i
            j One squad worked under the the tin i
            j shop and the other attacked the dirt |
            j bottom of the. cellar, near the rear and I
            I west walls. It was clcse to the parti- .
            | tion between the rear and front cellars,
            j under the stairs leading from the tin (
            I shop, that early in the afternoon the j
            i two masses of quicklime were found.
            I Two bones and masses of hair were
            found in them. A long, wooden, shal- '
            j low vat was found two feet under the i
            ground. It was expected that when j
            cleared out evidences that a human I
            body had been buried there would be !
            found but the examination resulted
            i in nothing of the kind. Either it was
            a blind sewer or a secret repository.
            A LETTER TO PAT.
            The police have found a letter from
            . Holmes to Pat Quinlan, to which much
            importance is attached. The letter is
            j as follows:

            asked you to do anything illegal,- but
            they are bull-headed. Oct. 13 I saw

            MURDER OF JULIA CONNOR.
            Asphyxiated, Cut Up and Cremat
            ed hy Holmes.
            CHICAGO, July 27.-Mrs. Patrick
            Quinlan lost her defiant spirit in the
            police inquisition. Two days' "sweat-
            DOX experience proved more than she
            £m I»v.beai;1 »v. beai ;. wit equanimity, and she
            told the police things which before had
            not been acknowledged. Chief of Po
            lice Badenoch said: Evidence secured
            from Mrs. Quinlan is highly important,
            fahe confessed to abetting Holmes in
            insurance swindles, and that is a step
            in the right direction. Patrick Quin
            lan, her husband, continues to protest
            he was a mere hireling, and roes not
            know Holmes' affairs at all. Mrs. Quin
            lan s evidence was that, after Mrs.
            Connor s disappearance it became nec
            essary for Holmes to produce her to
            collect some insurance. Mrs. Quinlan
            consented to act in her place. She
            went to the insurance office and swore
            she was Mrs. Connor, and signed that
            name. According to the statements of
            Jonathan Belmont it was Christmas
            night, four years and six months ago,
            that Mrs. Connor was killed.
            He believes she was asphyxiated in
            her room while she slept. Her room
            was a small one adjoining the dark
            ! bath room in the "castle." When all
            was still in the house Holmes switched
            on the gas. When the deed was ac
            complished Holmes stealthily admitted
            himself through- the secret door of the
            bath room, lifted the inanimate form
            ol Mrs. Connor from the bed, and car
            ried it to the bath room. Then, placing
            the body in the bath tub, he proceeded
            to cut It to pieces, and fed them to a
            hot fire in the stove. When all was
            done he took the ashes and parts of
            the body that had not been entirely
            burned and buried them in lime in the
            cellar. ■_._,.■..
            The police believe the chain of evi
            dence against Pat Quinlan now com
            plete, and Holmes' ex-janitor will be
            tried for murder here.
            A HISSING BROTHER.
            "Horace Williams Disappeared Be
            fore His Sisters Were Rilled.
            CHICAGO, July 27.— William Capps.
            the Fort Worth, Texas, attorney who
            is here in behalf of the heirs of the'
            Williams sisters, advanced a rather
            startling theory today, which if found
            to be true, will add another victim
            to the long list of murders already
            credited to Holmes. According- to
            Capps, Minnie R. Williams ' had a
            brother named Horace A. Williams in j
            Denver, Col. This young man either 1
            was killed or disappeared ' in May .or
            June, ISS3, shortly before the supposed
            murder of the Williams .sisters. The
            manner of his death iSjiiot known to
            the attorney, but he says he has ascer
            tained that the young man was insured '
            for $2,500 in favor of his sister Minnie.
            This fact Mr. Capps considers to be
            decidedly peculiar, as he says it is not
            reasonable to suppose Horace Williams
            would insure his life in favor of a sis
            ter who was already wealthy. He said
            that his Investigations upon this point
            were in an uncompleted state, but
            from what he had learned he was of the
            opinion that Holmes had first insured
            the young man and then been instru
            mental In causing his death.

            Williams Li, es Mediums Interview
            Enieline Cigrscd.
            Chicago, III., Aug. 2. The police have
            at last obtained a partial confession
            from Pat Quinlan, the janitor of the
            Holmes "castle" and have, they be
            lieve, positive evidence that Benjamin
            F. Pietzel was murdered in this city by
            Holmes and the corpse sent to Phila
            delphia. The confession was wormed out of
            Quinlan by means of a tip given the
            local officers by Detective Geyer of
            Philadelphia, who arrived in this city
            today. The exact nature of the story
            told by Quinlan the police will not re
            veal and in fact Chief Badenoch and
            Inspector Fitzpatrick have both denied
            that Quinlan or his wife made any con
            fession at all. Notwithstanding the
            denial of the police, however, it is posi
            tively known that Quinlan made a
            signed confession because it was left
            where Quinlan's signature on the docu
            ment could be seen, although the sub
            ject matter under which he wrote his
            name .could not be ascertained. Tonight
            however, it was learned that a confes
            sion was made covering all the detils
            of the murder of Pietzl with the ex
            ception of the actual place in which
            the crime was committed.
            This the police declare they will have
            tomorrow and they declare that by sun
            set of Aug. 5, they will have undisput
            able evidence that Pietzel came to his
            end through the direct agency of II. II.
            Holmes. The confession was obtained
            from the Quinlans only after the hard
            est kind of work, and at the price of a
            promise of immunity from punishment
            for all the part the Quinlan's may have
            borne in the murder of Pietzel or other
            crimes committed by Holmes.
            MINNIE WILLIAMS LIVES.
            Little Rock, Aug. 2. Attorney O. M.
            Humphreys of Fort Worth arrived here
            today and went almost imemdiately to
            the prison where he and Superintend
            ent McConnell were closeted for some
            time with Convinct Allen. Mr. Hum

            claims against Minnie Wiliam's prop
            erty in Fort Worth on debts contract
            ed by Holmes and his accomplices.
            After the conference he sead:
            "Undoubtedly Allen knows more than
            anybody else about the transfer of the
            Williams property because he spoke to
            me intelligently about the various pa
            pers conected with the deal which are
            now In my possession and the contents
            of which have never been made public.
            I knew Allen in Fort Worth and from
            circumstances as yet unpublished which
            he mentioned to me today, in connec
            tion with those deals. I know he was
            intimate with Holme"."
            "Do you think Minnie Williams is
            still alive?"
            "I most assuredly do. From what I
            know and from what Allen said today,
            I am positive that she is not only liv
            ing but that she is in the United States
            and that were Holmes free he would be
            with her in less than forty-eight hours."
            WHAT MRS. QUINLAN KNOWS.
            Mrs. Pat Quinlan knew of the disap
            pearance of Mrs. Julia L. Conner in
            Holmes' castle and saw the body of
            the woman after she was elead. She
            further knew and has admitted that
            Pearl Conner disappeared mysterious
            ly in the castle after her return from
            a trip to the Quinlan farm at Lake
            Michigan.
            Chief Badenoch took Mrs. Quinlan
            and her husband to the castle today
            with Inspector Fitzpatrick and detec
            tives Fitzpatrick and Norton. The ob
            ject of this trip was more for the pur
            pose of letting Quinlan and his wife
            meet than any other. They were clos
            eted together alone for an hour in the
            room in which the Julia Conner's car
            pet lies and the chair belonging to the
            murdered woman stands. What took
            place between them no one knows but
            Chief Badenoch and his detectives. The
            chief now has proof positive that Mrs.
            Connor and Pearl, her daughter, or Co
            ra Quinlan, were murdered in the main
            building while the mother was in
            Holmes' employe. Quinlan has given
            information within the last twenty-four
            hours which brings the charge of mur
            der nearer to Holmes than it has been
            in Chicago at any time since the case
            opened. Quinlan and his wife while
            demonstrating to the police that they
            were at no time guilty of the crime of
            murder themselves have made admis
            sions by which the chief could use
            them on the stand as valuable witness
            es against Holmes in proving that Mrs.
            Conner anil a child were made away
            with by Holmes for the purpose of se
            curing insurance which Mrs. Cononr
            carried on her life in favor of her
            daughter or in which Cora Quinlan
            cut an important figure.
            Further, Quinlan and his wife have
            proved to the police that Mrs. Con
            nor was so Avell aware of the schemes
            which Holmes were operating that it
            became necessary for Holmes to put
            the woman out of the way.
            Mrs. Connor's bo lv was disposed of
            by burial within tne castle somewhere
            close to tfie spot where Pearl's sup
            posed body was found. The police have
            not ceased their effort" to flnd the bot
            tom of the basement and uncover her
            remains. The digging which was sus
            pended today will continue tomorrow
            and during the coming week. Pat Quin
            Ian and his wife have admitted parti
            ally, the woman more than the man.
            that a business in receiving and dis
            posing of dead bodies stolen from
            country graveyards was carried on in
            the castle under tli direction of
            Holmes. The graveyards of the west
            ern portion of Michigan. Grand Haven
            South Haven. Muskeg.-.n.. Holland. St.
            Joseph. The Bay. Laka. all ancient
            places, with venerable graves were de-sp-Mled
            of bodies.
            The bodies were brought to the cas
            tle, chemically treated ani thn dis
            posed of to medfeal colleges The cof
            fins were re-made by Quinlan. Pietael
            and Holmes, reliaed and disposed of to
            undertakers at a fair profit.
            We have suOlcSent evidence to keep
            Holmes In prion for t he remainder of t
            his natural days" said Detective Geyer
            toiay. "wicnout cnarjnng- nim with

            two Williams girls. M'nnie Williams

            as reported. (
            Richardson corroborates Chappeirs
            story. He fcas told the police all he
            knows oi noimes .ramc in mysterious
            packages ana ooxes ana Debtees the
            express companies receipt? in the Wash

            1S91-93 and where the "packages" he
            handled were delivered.
            The new witness said he did not
            know what these packages contained
            at the time they were handled. To the
            police he made no reservations but
            since Chappell says his traffic was in
            dead men's bones Richardson says he
            is quite prepared to believe it. The num
            ber of these trips to the Wallace street
            house he adds cannot be contained In
            twenty calls, nor thirty.
            "X remember this special package
            very well," said Richardson. "Holmes
            sent these boxes all over the city at
            times to physicians and medical stu
            dents and again to the hospitals direct
            A good part of the stuff was also taken
            to the various depots. He received a
            good many consignments himsplf from
            other points. The boxes handled as I
            remember them were strong and ticht
            C-nd there were also well headed barrels
            in numbers. I don't remember of see
            ing that old trunk Chappell turned up
            r.or do I recall any trips to dump stuff
            in the lake. I guess Holmes had use
            for most everything he handled with
            out throwing anything away."
            MEMPHIS KICKS ON ALLEN.
            Memphis, Tenn., Aug. 2. The Little
            Rock end of the Holmes murder sen
            sation is about petered out. In the next
            forty-eight hours the police will in all
            probability, have proen tha Convict
            John Caldwell could have had no con
            nection with Holmes and his crimes, as
            he was in the Tennessee penitentiary
            for horse stealing at the time he claims
            to have been operating in Fort Worth
            Tex., for Holmes. A few months ago
            he was pordoned but went Immediate
            ly to Arkansas and engnged in his for
            mer pursuit. There he again came to
            grief and was sent to the Arkansas
            state prison where he now is. The
            Memphis police are confident Caldwell's
            story is only a ruse to get out of prison.
            WANTS PAY FOR TALK.
            Minneapolis, Minn., Aug. 2. "Two
            hundred dollars, sir." is the cash value
            placed by C. W. Arnold, the insurance
            agent, on his knowledge of the career
            of Holmes. Nevertheless for the last
            two days Arnold has been a constant at
            tendant at the newspaper offices here
            and has been interviewed to his heart's
            content.
            Arnold was asked point blank today
            as to his holding shares in the com
            panies organized by Holmes for vari
            ous purposes. If you like to pay me
            $200 I will write out what I know and
            hand It to you and the Minneapolis pa
            pers shall publish it at the same time.
            I will dictate it myself to a stenograph
            er, but I tell you before hand I do not
            think it worth a cent to you, as I had
            no knowledge of any crimes. Holmes
            used my name In those companies with
            out my knowledge or authority. In the
            same breath he added: "I never invest
            ed a cent in any of his companies and
            certainly had no knowledge of any of
            his swindling operations. I never went
            up stairs in the house or building. I
            never saw a stenographer or typewriter
            there. There was no handsome blonde
            typewriter there so far as I saw. I
            knew nothing of his vats or furnaces. I
            never sats them. I never saw, met, or
            knew Kmlllne Cigrand, Mrs. Connor,
            or her daughter, Mrs. Lee, Minle Will
            iams or her sister, nor Emily von Tas
            sel. I never insured any of those peo
            ple for Holmes or at Holmes sugges
            tion. All I can say is as to my person
            al dealings with and friendship for Mr.
            Holmes, and I am out for the stuff and
            intend to get it before I say anything.
            Two hundred dollars Is my price. You
            put up the money and I will write you
            a story of a dozen of extraordinary
            facts about Holmes, but I won't talk
            to reporters I am busyv There Is a
            good market for this kind of stuff. Why
            several novelists have already approac
            hed me and offered me large sums to
            tell what I know of Holmes for publi
            cation in book form. I am wanting the
            money and can use it In my business,
            nnd I shall not talk, I tell you, until I
            get it."
            Then Mr. Arnold, who had done most
            of the talking, waited for questions
            with the sang froid of an experienced
            politician. He was atked as to insur
            ances effected by him for Holmes or at
            Holmes' instigation and claimed that
            he insured Holmes by three separate
            policies for $5,000 each, which policies
            Holmes neglected to pay for or take up.
            Arnold admits insuring Pietzel for 2000
            but claims that this policy lapsed and
            long before Pietzel met his end. When
            asked for particulars as to insurance
            companies for whom he worked in Chi
            cago, Arnold denied positively having
            worked for the Mutual Life of Philadel
            phia, the Northwestern or the Vermont
            and in the same breath refused to say
            what companies he worked for.
            When questioned closely as to his
            dealingswith Holmes he claimed that
            his acquaintance was purely a passing
            friendship, though he might have act
            ed as witness to various legal docu
            ments. As to the nature of these he
            essayed to be very mysterious and he
            point blank asked for pecuniary com
            pensation for divulging. He absolute
            ly denies that he was out from 11 p m.
            until 3 a. m. on any occasion attting
            legal documents for Holmes ar. I cut
            short the conversation bv sa ing be
            would talk no more until S200 was forth
            coming for his information.
            SPIRITS ARE INVOKED.
            Anderson, Ind., Aug. 2. The friends
            of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Cigrand, whose
            daughter Emeline is believed to have
            been one of H. H. Holmes' victims, are
            much interested in the attempt by
            spiritualist seances to communicate
            with the spirit of Emeline. A number
            of people have had private sittings with
            mediums, but a they report no satis
            faction a woman whose name must be
            withheld went into a seance for the
            spirit of EmeJine.
            After sitting in a dark room for near
            ly two hours she ays there was a voice
            in the trumpet and she understood it to
            say:
            "This is Emma. I went into the spirit
            land two years ago and was far from
            home. O, it was so horrible." Here the
            words became whispers and were not
            audible. Suddenly another voice said:
            "I hope sister will soon join me. I
            have something awful to tell her. My
            husband is stil beyond the spirit land.
            I send love to mamma and papa, and
            tell the to " and here the spirit stop-
            ped and could not be called again.
            Mrs. Bibbeth Seery. one of the best
            of Indiana mediums, was sen at her
            home in Muncie tonight. Sho would
            not attempt to call up the spirit of
            Emeline Cigrand, for she said it was
            absurd.
            "The laws of aature are the govern
            ment r all mediums and spirit." said
            the medium. "The dead girl would have
            to be well known to any one speaking (
            who saould have talked with the girl
            in worldly life shortly before death. I
            Natural resources are arainst nie. for I
            saould one spirit be called and told to

            circumstances attending her death a
            reported it would affect the spiritual
            condition "
            A trance medium attempted to talk
            with the girl's spirit. He asuaied a
            trance state and speaking for a spirit
            EAld- ,
            "All seems dark; ao Hgnt asywhre: j

              STORY OP THH ARREST.
              Benjamin F. Piterel's liody was round In
              a house at 131C Callow hill street 011 Sep
              tember 3, 1894. A shattered lamp was
              found by the side of -the body wliUh bore
              evidence of having iie-en turned, and the
              coroner's Jury concluded ttiat tlie oil lamp
              had exploded and that Pilczcl, who was
              at the time known as M. F. Perry, had been
              burned to deutti. and accordingly rendered
              a vcntUt or accidental death.
              There was no claimant ror the body and
              it was buried in Potter's field. Subse
              quently an assertion came iroin Mrs. Fltc
              zel's lawyer at St. Louis, Mr. Jeplha
              Uowe, that the body w.u that of Benjamin
              F. Pltezei, and a claim was made ou the
              Fidelity Mutual Life Association of Phil
              adelphia for $10,000, which that cotu
              pauy carries! on Pitezel's life.
              Tlie insurance company paid the claim,
              but not Is'iiig satisfied tti.it Pllc-zel had

              defraud the insurance company. Holmes
              pleaded guilty to Ihjs charge, but to cum
              bat tlie more serious ciiarge of inurdtr
              claimed that Pilczcl is still litiiig: that a

              GKYKU'S DISCOVERIES.
              Holmes was sent to prison to await sen

              Attorney Graham startesl Ilctcctlte Gcyer
              out to v lslt Toronto, Chicago and other
              Western cities, to endeavor to obtain ci
              dence against Holmes which would warrant
              his being arruigucs! for murder.

              District Attorney Graham that Holmes could

              as wltnisssMS against Holmes.
              The approaches to the court room were
              closely guarded, and Hone but jicrsons di
              rectly intcre-sted in the caso.and newspaper
              men, were admitted. The case was called
              shortly after 10 o'clock.
              Holmes walked Jauntily into tlie dock,
              a tipstaff being on cither side of him. He
              was rather pale from long conrincment in
              tlie county prison, but his black beard was
              neatly trimmed, and his black suit of
              clothing gave him adressy appearance.
              Tlie accused took his sent with a calmness
              that was noticeable, and whlleheetlnceda
              decided interest in the matters at issue,
              there was no look of fear upon Ms counto
              nance nor any evidence of nervousness in
              his action.
              SENSATIONAL EPISODE.
              , Judge Arnold overruled the motions for
              postponement in a very few words, and
              ordered the trial to go on. Just at this
              Juncture a startling climax was reached,
              which resulted in the withdrawal of Law
              yers Shoemaker and Rotan from the case,
              notwithstanding an injunction from tho
              court that they would be open to disbar
              ment by taking such a step "ou the eveof a
              murder trial."
              Stili further sensation was created wiien
              Holmes refused to accept the services of
              Attorney! Everett A. Sehofield and Joseph.
              R. Fahy, whom the court was about to ap
              point to -defend him and who, lu fact, had
              taken "scats in the hairs vacated by Messrs.
              Shoemaker and Rotan.
              Sehorieldaud Fahy also withdrew. Holmes
              himself pleaded to the court for a post
              ponement, but the Judge declared that
              tho case must go on. The trial was re
              sumed, Holmes conducting his own defense.

              Toledo, Ohio, Oct. 28. Ever since Sat
              urday night a desperate fire has been raging
              in the coal regions south of here.
              The telegraph and telephone lines arc
              nearly all rendered useless in that Immedi
              ate vicinity, and detailed reports of the
              damage have been difficult to secure.
              The fire seems to have done most damage
              about Merndl, Cygnet and Lucky. Among
              the heaviest losers are the Sun 011 Company,
              nine derricks, four tanks and a boiler
              house, the Palmer Oil Company, twelveder
              rlcks, several tanks and other property;
              the Ohio Oil Company, four derricks and
              other property. Half Brothers, several der
              ricks and buildings.
              The fire startesl on Hie edge of the town
              of Vungen, and burnesl two miles to the
              northeast, a strip nearly a mile wide, de
              stroying everything. This is the heart of
              the best producing oil territory in Ohio.
              The fire is now practically under con
              trol, and while the loss ivlll be very heavy
              from reports at hand, an accurate estimate
              cannot be given. One estimate is $1C0,
              000, others higher.

              The Execution Passed Off Without
              Any Incidents of a Sensa
              tional Nature.
              PHILADELPHIA, Pa., May 7.—Her
              man W. Mudgett, alias H. H. Holmes,
              was hanged this" mornine in the County
              Prison for tne killing of Benjamin F.
              Pietzel.
              The drop fellatlO:l2o'cloctc, and twenty
              minutes later he was pronounced dead by
              the prison officials, Dr. Sharp and Dr.
              Batcher.
              The execntion was in every way entirely
              devoid of any sensational features.
              To the last Holmes was self-possessed
              and cool, even to the extent of giving a
              word of advice to Assistant Superintend
              ent Richardson as the latter -was arrang
              ing the final details. He died as ne had
              lived, unconcerned and thoughtless, ap
              parently, of the future, even with the rec
              ollection still vividly before him of the
              H. H. Holmes, alias Mudgett, the Arch Criminal of Modern History. Who Was
              Hanged Yesterday.
              recent confession in which he admitted
              the killing of a score of persons of both
              sexes in different parts of the country.
              Almost his last words were a point-blank
              denial of any crimes committed except the
              deaths of two women at his hands by mal
              practice.
              Of the murder of several members of tbe
              Pietzel family he denied all complicity,
              particularly of the father, for whose death
              he stated he was unjustly suffering the
              penalty. With the prayer of the spiritual
              attendants still sounding in his ears and
              with a few low-spoken words to those
              about him tbe trap was sprang.
              There were comparatively few persons
              gathered on the outside of the prison dur
              ing the eariy part of the morning and the
              morbid throng which the prison officials
              expected would be drawn there by the
              execution was lacking. Access to the
              prison prior to the entrance of those per
              mitted to witness the execution was not
              allowed.
              All the arrangements for the burial of
              Holmes were entrusted by the murderer
              to Mr. Rotan. The place of interment has,
              it is understood, been selected, but those
              who are most likely to know where the
              grave is to be will not divulge the iov-a
              tion.
              Holmes retired about midnight and
              slept soundly during the entire time until
              called at 6 o'clock this morning. So sound
              were his slumbers, in fact, that twice was
              he called before awauening. When the
              arrival of the Rev. Fathers Dailey and Me-
              Pake to administer the sacrament was an
              nounced he greeted them warmly, but
              witii no show of emotion. For nearly two
              hours they remained in the cell and then
              were succeeded by Lawyer Rotan, the le
              gal adviser of Holmes, who was also
              greeted pleasantly. There were several
              matters pertaining to Holmes' worldly af
              fairs that will yet have to be settled and
              this time was taken in giving the final de
              tails and explanations. While discussing
              his affairs breakfast was served, consisting
              of eggs, toast and coffee.
              When the raeal was ended, shortly be
              fore 9 o'clock, Holmes dressed himself in
              trousers, vest and cutaway coat of some
              dark mixed goods of a pepper and salt ef
              fect he aad worn frequently.
              At 10 o'clocK the doors leading to the
              long corridor in which was placed the
              gallows were opened and, two by two, led
              by the Sheriff's jury, the spectators
              passea down. The last man had just
              passed through the doors and the latter
              closed when from behind was heard the
              slow and measured tread of the death
              party.
              The suspense was almost painful, brief
              though it was, when, preceded by Sheriff
              Clements and Superintendent Perkins,
              Holmes appeared and stepped on the trap.
              On the right was Father Dailey, to the
              left Fat; er McPake, and behind them
              Lawyer Rotan and Assistant Superin
              tendent Richardson. The little party
              stood a moment looking down, and then,
              in response to a signal from one of those
              beside him, Holmes stepped forward. He
              spoke slowly and with measured attention
              to every word— a trifle low at first, but
              louder as he proceeded, until every woid
              was distinctly audible.
              "Gentlemen," he said, "I have very few
              words to say, in fact, I would make no
              statemeut at this time, except that by not
              speaking I may be made to acquiesce in
              my execution. I only want to say that
              the extent of my wrongdoings in the
              taking of human life consisted in the
              death of two women, they having died at
              my hands as the result of criminal opera
              tions. I wish to state also, however, so that
              there will be no misunderstanding here
              after, tnat I am not guilty of taking the
              lives of any of the Pietzel family, the three
              children or the father, Benjamin F. Piet
              zel, of whose death I am now convicted,
              and for which I am to-day to be hanged.
              That is all."
              As he ceased speaking he stepped back,
              and kneeling between Fathers Dailey and
              McPake, he joined with them in silent
              prayer for a minute or two. Again stand
              ing he sbook hands with all about him
              and then signified his readiness for the
              end. Holmes was the coolest of the wuole
              yiarty. He even went to the extreme of
              suggesting to Assistant Superintendent
              Richardson that the latter should not
              hurry himself.
              "Take your time; don't bungle it,"
              Holmes remarked as the official exhibited
              some little haste, the outcome of nervous
              ness. These were almost his last words.
              The cap was adjusted, a low-toned query,
              "Are you ready?" and an equally low
              toned response, "Yes, good-by," and the
              trap was sprung.
              Holmes' neck was not broken, and there
              were a few convulsive twitches of the
              limbs that continued for about ten min
              utes. "But he suffered none after the
              drop," said Dr. Scott, the prison physi
              cian.
              The trap was sprung precisely at ]0:12)£,
              and fifteen minutes later Holmes was pro
              nounced dead, though the body was not
              cut down until 10:45. When ii was laid
              out on the stretcher occurred the only in
              cident approaching the revolting in con
              nection with the affair.
              The knot bad become jammed and the
              efforts of the doctors failed to loosen it as
              they attempted to remove the noose from
              about the neck. The head was twisted
              about from side to side in the attempt, and
              finally it was decided to cut the rope.
              Superintendent Perkins objected, however,
              and the knot was undone after several
              minutes of trying work.
              After the body had been viewed by the
              physicians and the manner of death dt
              termined the stretcher on whicn it lay was
              wheeled out of the corridor into the jail
              yard. Hero it was placed in an ordinary
              cheap pine coffin, wide enough and deep
              enough to have held two men of Holmes'
              size. The coffin was put aboard an under
              taker's wagon and conveyed to the Roman
              Catholic Cemetery of the Holy Cross.
              The only persons at the cemetery were
              the undertaker and his assistant, two
              grave-diggers, two watchmen and a couple
              of newspaper men. The little company
              acted as pallbearers, and carried the coffin
              to the receiving vault. The last act in tne
              receiving vault was performed at Holmes'
              express command.
              The lid of the coffin was taken off and
              the body was lifted out and laid on the
              ground. Then the bottom of tbe coffin
              was filled with cement. The body was
              then replaced in the coffin and covered
              with cement. It was Holmes' idea that
              this cement would harden around his
              body and prevent any attempt at grave
              robbery. The coffin was left in the receiv
              ing vault under the guard of two watch
              men, who will remain on duty all night.
              To-morrow afternoon the body will be in
              terred in a grave in the cemetery, and it is
              probable that at the time religious serv
              ices will be conducted by Father Dailey.
              Holmes made no will and left no con
              fession. This is according to Mr. Rotan.
              He says he knows Holmes made no will,
              and, while the murderer gave him this
              mornine a big bundle of papers, the law
              yer says that he is confident that these
              papers relate only to private business
              matters. A3 yet Mr. Rotan has had no
              opportunity to examine them.
              Mrs, Pietzel was seen after Holmes was
              hanged. All she could say, between her
              sobs, was that she was glad that he had
              received her just deserts, but that his
              death would not return to her her hus
              band or her children. Mrs. Pietzel will
              return to her home, at Galva, 111., next
              week.
              The two women referred to by Holmes
              in nis confession from the scaffold were
              Julia Connor of Chicago and Emily
              Cigrand of Anderson, Ind.
              HOLMES' MANY CRIMES.
              He Had a Ready "Confession" to Clear
              Himself of Ench.
              Herman W. Mudgett, better known as
              H. H. Holmes, was one of the most con
              spicuous criminals of modern times, and
              If the "murder confessions" which he has
              written can only partially be believed, he
              was without a peer as a bloodthirsty
              demon. His recent ingenious "confes
              sion," wherein he claimed to have killed
              twenty-seven persons, was disproved,
              partly, at least, by the appearance of sev
              eral of the so-called victims: but Holmes'
              object in making the "confession" was re
              alized — the obtaining of a sum said to be
              $7500 and which amount is said to have
              been settled upon the criminal's 18-year
              old son. While the "confessions" have
              served to increase the sensationalism of
              the case, the only capital crime for which
              Holmes had to answer was the killing in
              this city on September 2, 1884, of Benja
              min F. Pietzel, bis fellow-conspirator.
              The murder was committed in the dwell
              ing, 1316 Callowhill street. Holmes' con
              viction of murder in the first degree, the
              affirmation by the Pennsylvania Supreme
              Court of the verdict and the recent re
              fusal of Governor Hastings to grant a re
              spite, are so well known that a narration
              oJ these facts is unnecessary.
              Holmes was captured in Boston, Mass.,
              in the latter part of 1894 by Owen Hans
              com. the Deputy Superintendent of

              for tho burning of a human body.
              A person could be thrown into the
              stove bodily and could be burned to
              nothing.

              FINDING OF BODY
              STARTS SEARCH.
              The finding of the body of a vic
              tim always starts the search for the
              slayer. If a man could dispose of
              tho body he could slay on a whole
              sale plan and avoid detection.
              Holmes is believed to have built the
              castle with a view of hiding bodies
              of those he slew. He directed the
              work on the building. Qulnlan was
              only an ordinary workman who did
              what he was told unhesitatingly.
              Qulnlan never questioned the au
              thority of the slayer. He never
              asked who the women were Holmes
              had visiting him. He never asked
              where they went when they disap
              peared. He was an ideal servant.
              Born in a small Michigan commun
              ity he went to Chicago to make his
              fortune. Chicago was about to have
              a world's fair in commemoration of
              the. discovery of America.
              It was a good town to go to,
              thought Quinlan. An honest Irish
              young man, hla only thought of mak
              ing a living was by honest hard
              work. That Is why he went to work
              for Holmes and worked so wllllng
              ly and so faithfully. The other day
              w hen he drank the fatal potion he
              was middle-aged and broken in
              health. He looked as though he had
              been carried to the point of death
              by tho ghosts of the slain women of
              the castlo ho helped to build.
              It is said by some of his best
              friends that he often reproarhed
              himself for his part In the affair.
              Ho blamed himself for not suspect
              ing Holmes and turning him up to
              the police. Yet he could not bo
              blamed. Every thing in Holmes Cas
              tle seemed to be right. There was
              no sign of murder there. Every
              thing was quiet and still. The rooms
              were lined with asbestos and the
              dying victims never made a sound
              that reached the outsldo world.
              There at night In tho dark house
              they met their death.
              Some of them wero asphyxiated.
              It la believed. Others wore stabbed.

              Others were shot, according to the
              opinions of investigator. No one
              knows. Holmes knew and the vic
              tims perhaps could tell harrowing
              tales if they could talk, but theyr are
              gone and Holmes has been hung for
              his crimes, so In this world no one
              ever will know.
              How many crimes Holmes devised
              no one can tell. Tho first thing to
              attract the attention of tho world
              was the sudden, horrible death of
              B. F. PSetzel. a ihemlst. in Phila
              delphia He died In such a man
              ner that It seerued ho had been
              making chemical experiments and
              had met with an accident Mien his
              chemicals exploded. Holme-, whoso
              right name was Herman "W. Mucl
              cett, telegraphed to St Louis to the
              homo of Mrs Pletzcl and told her to
              rome to Philadelphia and Identify
              the body.
              It is alleged that Holmes met Mrs.
              Pletzel and informed her the body
              was not that of her husband but
              that her husband had his life in
              sured for 10. 000.
              "He's saf- in Canada." Holmes
              told Mrs Pletzel. "He had itim
              frame up this body. It Is t-o badly
              mangled by the explosion that no
              one can ever recognize it Tou
              identify it and we 11 get the insur
              ance. Your husband said for me to
              gl e you half and bring the otner
              half to him."
              Mrs Pletzel later confessed that
              she Identifcd the body without be
              lieving it was that of her husband.
              She thought it was a big swindle
              game on the part of her husband
              and she entered into it readily She
              brought her three children. Alice,
              Nellie and Howard with her. Alice
              was 15 years old. Holmes sepa
              rated her from her children and
              took them to Toronto, Canada,
              Later the bodies, of Alice and
              Nellie were found In the cellar of a
              building Holmes had occupied at
              Toronto.

              drat directed attention to Holmes.
              Holmes was conducting a drug atoro
              In St Louis when he was arrested on
              a minor charge and placed In jail.
              There ho met Marion Hedgepeth,
              noted as an out and out criminal.
              Holmes asked Hcdgepeth to tell him
              the name of some St, Louis lawyer
              who could give him assistance In
              putting over an Insurance swindle.

              Hedgepeth said he gave him the
              name. In return Hedgepeth was to
              get $500. The swindle was con
              summated. That is Pletzel was
              killed in Philadelphia in order to col
              let the Insurance, but Hedgepeth got
              no money.
              Then Hedgepeth notified Chief of
              Police Harrlgan of St. Louis that he
              had "the biggest insurance swindle
              case the police ever had to deal
              with anywhere, anytime in the
              world'
              He sent that message to Harrlgan
              October 9. 1894. Pietzel had died
              September 3. 1894. That failure to
              deal squarely with Hedgepeth is
              doubtless what cost Holmes his
              liberty and life and checked his
              long career of crime. Police at
              once set out to hunt for him. The
              Philadelphia death of Pietzel had
              caused them some wonder, but tho
              word from Hedgepeth made them
              doubly cure of crime. They trailed
              Holmes to Toronto, where the
              bodies of Alice and Nellie Pletzel
              were found. Later they found the
              body of Howard In Indianapolis and
              Identified it as that of Howard, be
              cause of some peculiar playthings
              he had. His body had been burned
              In a stove and the bones alone were
              left Intact.
              Holmes was found In Boston and
              arrested. He was going under tho
              name of Howard there. He was ar
              rested July 14. 1895.
              Mrs. Pletzel told her part in the
              afflr and tried to atone by fisht
              lng for the conviction of the man
              who had made her a widow and
              had slain three of her beautiful
              children.
              In Chicago the record of Holmes
              was looked up. When he was un
              der arrest in Philadelphia awaiting
              trial for the death of Pletzel word
              .ame from all parts of tho United
              Slates that Holmes, or a man an
              swering his description, had taken
              women from their town and the
              unfortunates had never been heard
              from
              From Fort Worth came the In
              formation that Miss Minnie Wil
              liams and her sister, Anna, had
              been led away by Holmes several
              years before and no one had ever
              heard of them. It was found that
              Miss Minnie Williams had entered
              Holmes castlo under the supposi
              tion that she was to be the wife of
              the arch-slayer. She sent to Fort
              Worth for her sister. Anna, to be
              a bridesmaid at the w:diing.
              The sisters had JG0.000 worth
              of property In Forth Worth. They
              were induced to borrow heavily on
              the property and that Is the last
              anyone heard of them. Minnie, the
              bride-elect, died before the wedding
              In Holmes Castle Anna, the brides-mald-to-be.
              also died without ever
              having a chance to wear her bridal
              clothes What happened to tho
              bodies no one knows for certain.
              In the fine of the chimney, whlh
              led from the big stove on the top
              floor, hair was found. It Is believed
              that the hair was that of the sisters
              as It corresponded to their hair The
              theory was advanced at the time
              that the sisters were thrown Into the
              stove and burned. The suction of
              the flue carried the hair up In the
              flue, where it remained as mute evi
              dence against Holmes.
              From Davenport, Io., came an
              other story of disappearance and
              Holmes name was linked with that
              too. Mrs.v Julia Connor and her
              daughter were the missing ones.
              BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
              AND DAUGHTER LOST.
              For more than three years prior
              to 1 895, Mrs. Julia 1 Connor and
              her daughter, Pearl, had been mlss-
              ing from their friends in Iowa.
              Mrs. Connor had gone to Chicago
              v.ith her husband and daughter to
              work in a drug store conducted by
              Holmes. The drug store failed and
              Holmes gave the property to Con
              nor. Mrs. Connor was so taken with
              his generosity that she ceased to
              love her husband. She returned to
              Davenport and Connor obtained a
              divorce.
              Then she returned to Chicago, os
              tensibly to open a boarding house
              in Chicago or the suburbs. She and
              hor daughter never were heard of
              again. When Holmes was arrested
              in Philadelphia, relatives of Julia
              Connor claimed he killed her.
              Many bones wero found around
              Holmes Castle. He explained they
              were beef bones. He explained that
              the flat had been used as a restau
              rant during the World's Fair at Chi
              cago and that much meat was used
              there. He explained that the huge
              dumb waiter was used to convey
              food. He explained that the as
              bestos was to make the house fire
              proof and to keep out cold.
              He had an excuse for everything.
              He admitted he was crooked. He
              explained that he went to Toronto
              to smuggle furs into the United 111?!
              States. He admitted knowing alt
              the women ho was accused of mur-
              dering He admitted knowing Piet- Ewg
              zel. He denied killing any of them. H&l
              Damaging evidence against him Bb
              were buttons of the women he was KhI
              charged with killing, which were
              found in his castle. bIH
              But the defense of Holmes netted LH
              him nothing. He swung from the hI
              gallows for his crimes.
              Though Holmes paid for his mis- jlfl
              deeds with death, Qulnlan suffered Bl
              much more than he. He was ar- LH
              rested with Holmes but freed.
              When he went back to his Mlchl- W

              ter of eyes Everywhere he went he

            THERE was no sudden flash of lightning,
            no sound of demoniac trumpets, no sul
            len roll of thunder to announce to the
            world that a dark prince was horn when, on
            the 16th of May in 1660. a country doctor at
            Gilmanton, New Hampshire, wrote into the
            birth records the name of Herman Mudgett.
            In school young Mudgett was remembered
            for a certain precocity; a deft hand and lumi
            nous black eyes. At sixteen he, himself, was
            schoolmaster, and two years later, considered
            the "catch” of the region, he courted, won and
            married the "local belle”—Clara Lovering
            Her family had money and in 1679 her
            father, impressed with Herman's mental abil
            ity. willingly sent the young couple to Ann
            Arbor, where Mudgett wished to study medi
            cine at the University of Michigan.
            If he played practical jokes in the dissect,
            ting room and unmercifully hazed other Fresh
            men with "spare parts” and. skeletons, it was
            put down as the exut* ntiee and
            enthusiasm of a budding genius
            Rut in his Sophomore year Mudgett
            hatched a high-jinx that no amount i
            of toleration could regard as a prank A
            A fellow student was insured for
            $1 000 with Mudgett the beneficiary
            Then a cadaver was stolen from the Wj
            medical school and planted as the
            dead body of the insured.
            Mudgett had the supf*>sed body of

            self H H Holmes
            opened a pharmacy
            in midtown Phila
            delphia. He had

            a I>r H H Holmes,
            1 um i noil s - e y e d.
            soft-spoken and ob-
            viously well off. who purchased a three-story
            corner building on 63rd Street, a substantial
            property with stores on the ground fl«»or.
            apartments upstairs, overhanging bastion
            upper windows and a corner apothecary shop.
            It had a vaguely sinister look, even before
            the impressive-looking doctor bought it
            Dr. Holmes reserved the upper floors of
            this castle for himself. The drugstore he
            rented to I L. Connor, who had a pretty wife
            and an infant daughter, Gertrude. Mr. and
            Mrs Connor especially Mrs Connor- thought
            Dr. Holmes a charming landlord.
            He spent a lot of energy installing modern
            plumbing, putting down floors, tearing out
            walls, constructing a third-floor laboratory.
            Much of this work he did himself and
            (somewhat to buxom Mrs. Connor’s envy)
            included among the installations a blond sei -
            retary. Miss Emily Cigrand.
            During the next~four years a prosperous
            Herman Holmes operated a chain of small
            drugstores through the Middle West.
            Tn St. Louis kindly Dr. Holmes became
            interested in a shabby drug clerk named Ben
            jamin Pitezel who had four small children
            and an ailing (but pretty) wife.
            Generously the doctor put Pitezel in charge
            of his St. Louis stores while he commuted
            between St. Louis and Chicago.
            Some time during this period of expansion
            the good doctor raised a glossy, blue-black
            beard. Too, on one of his returns to Chicago
            he told Mrs. Connor that Miss Cigrand had
            left, and ho was seeking a new secretary.
            So. presently, there was a new face in tho
            home office on 63rd Street--that of Minnie
            Williams, a pretty Texas girl.
            In a chain of letters to her sister Nettie,
            in Fort Worth, she confessed that she was
            falling in love. In 1893 Minnie invited Nettie
            to Chicago. Dr. Holmes, it appeared, wouldn’t
            think of leading her to the altar unless her
            rister were on hand to witness the ceremony.
            Nettie journeyed to Chicago forthwith The
            \ . edding was quiet hut beautiful. Dr. Holmes

            made such a thoughtful

            So thought Mrs. Con
            nor one day when she was
            downstairs alone and the
            doctor strolled in to col
            lect the rent.
            ”1 haven’t seen Minnie
            and Nettie all week Are
            they away?" she asked.
            The doctor nodded, pet

            Tn 1894 a Philadelphia paper carried an
            account of a ''mysterious chemical explosion ”
            An amateur inventor calling at the office
            of “B. t\ Perry Patents Bought and Sold’’
            in a dingy building on Callow hill Street was
            shocked to find the pa**nt attorney dead on
            the* floor, his features burned beyond recog
            nition and the room strewn with charred
            papers, broken glass and other wret kage
            The inventor rushed for the police
            The bluecoats decided Perry had been killed
            during an experiment with some sort of «x
            --plosive. Then, searching his effects they
            could find no business papers, no means of
            identification other than the name on his door.
            Detectives Frank Geyer and Thomas Craw*
            ford, assigned to the case, found other mys
            teries. Although the face was destroyed as
            though by volatile and or chemic al, the body
            lay in an attitude of composure.
            Among shattered test tubes and parapher
            nalia. they found the victim's pmc neatly
            loaded with tobacco. A box of matches had
            not been ignited by tho blast
            “Funny nolmdy in the neighborhood heard
            it,” Geyer remarked
            And on top of that, the pest mm em it-

            vealed chloroform in the victim’s stomach.
            Geyer and Crawford were suspicious, but
            the coroner’s verdict was “death- induced by
            explosion, probably suicide."
            One Week after the burial in potter
            field, the authorities received a letter from a
            Chicago lawyer. Jeptha Howe, asserting that

            In a few* days the tardy claimants arrived.
            Mrs Carrie Pitezel. described as ill, was r.< f

            In tears, fourteen-year-old Alice had diffi
            culty recognizing the disinterred corpse, but
            friend Holmes spoke up quietly. “If it’s poor
            Pitezel. he’ll have a mole on his left shoulder
            blade!”
            The identifying mole was found.

            As always. Holmes was generous. He told
            Mrs. Pitezel to travel on this money to Bur
            lington. Vermont, with her youngest child and
            new baby. He would keep Alice, Nellie and
            Howard, the oldest children, in his rare until
            Mrs. Pitezel could rjiove into a house he owned
            in Burlington. Mrs. Pitezel obeyed
            Poor Alice, Nellie and toddling Howard set
            out for what he called his "castle in Chicago."
            This was in October, 1894.
            Mrs. I, L Connor. Incidentally, who had
            separated from her husband to become the
            doctor’s secretary, was no longer at the Chi
            cago address. Neither was her little daughter.
            Meanwhile Detectives Geyer and Crawford
            had received a startling communication from
            Mrs Pitezel in Vermont and summoned h* r to
            Philadelphia immediately.
            Mrs. Pitezel told them an appalling
            story. Holmes was a master swindler, she
            asserted! Substituting medical cadavers for
            insured accomplices, he’d made a fortune on
            fraudulent death claims. He had Induced
            her husband to take part in such a fraud, but
            she was afraid no substitution had been made!,'
            "He keeps writing to me that Ben is in
            hiding But his 1« tters are evasive. I know
            he murdered 'ihn! And Uc w *x)t my three
            fatal explosion.”
            , The detectives
            didn’t like the smell
            of it Against their
            private advice, how
            ever. the life insur
            ance company mailed
            a check for SIO,OOO
            to widowed Carrie
            Pitezel.
            Dr Holmes had
            an.irved to meet
            Mrs. Pitezel in St.
            Ivtniis where the check
            was cashed and
            $2 800 paid to Law
            yer Howe. Then, in
            a confidential talk
            with Mrs. Pitezel,
            Holmes revealed an
            unpaid debt of $7,000
            against her husband.
            He advised Mrs. Pite
            z« 1 to let him handle
            this, and she gave
            oldest children with him in Chicago 1”
            Geyer and Crawford were inclined to share
            Mrs. Pitezel’* fears as they set out to locate
            Dr. Holmes and the children. The trail was
            a snake-track, but by dogged persistence, aided
            by the postal authorities, they traced his
            career from Mudgett to medical king with
            the gloomy ’’castle’’ in Chicago.
            On the way they found little Howard in a
            house in Indianapolis, his tiny body stuffed up
            a fireplace chimney.
            They learned Holmes owned the house, but
            if was not until they broke into the Chicago
            < ,i*tle that they knew they were dealing with
            the century’s worst mass murderer.
            There they found a sound-proofed chamber,
            surgical tools and torture instruments.
            A trap door in the hathroom led down to a
            secret oubliette in the cellar. There, in a
            furnace and under the floor, they found the
            bones and charred remnants of the Williams
            sisters, Mrs. Connor, children, wives and sec
            retaries. There was evidence to indicate he
            had sold Miss Cigrand s skeleton to a medical
            academy!
            It was not difficult to picture the suave
            Holmes ushering his victim* gallantly down
            the stairs to have them pause, transfixed, as
            many things became clear to them in one re
            vealing instant.
            The detectives redoubled their effort.
            Holmes, they learned, had departed for
            Vermont. And there they arrested the livid
            man; he had gone Fast to wipe out the re
            mainder of the Pitezel family!
            No one knows or will ever know the total
            of his killings. Taken to Philadelphia, he con
            fessed to two murders a year over a period of
            approximately fourteen years.
            Blubbering in his beard, he went to the
            Moyamensing Prison gallows on May 7. 1895
            Then, lethal to the eyes blazing, he pro
            nounced a curse on all the persons who had
            contributed to hia downfall.
            Within a year the prison warden, the
            coroner, the undertaker who embalmed him,
            and the Jury foreman were dead, l ie follow
            ing year the hangman fell dead, another
            juryman committed suicide, and the prie.
            who heard his confession was found dead ir an
            alley with a fractured skull. And in 1912 De
            tective Crawford, laughing at a joke about
            Holmes, himself fell dead
            ’ Up until Hitler, historians considered the
            Roman Emperor, Caligula, the foulest man
            of all time They overlooked Herman Mudgett.

            THE MOON LADY.
            Illustration by Ethel Reed from Mrs. Blodgett's "Fairy Tales." Copyright, 1896 by
            Lamson, Wolfe & Co.
            the non-heredity of acquired charac
            teristics, becomes by virtue of his own
            account of himself and of Dr. Tille's
            lucid introduction of his works, one of
            the most curious and interesting fig
            ures in modern thought.
            The thing for which Nietzsche really
            stands is the application of a physio
            logical rather than a psychological
            test to man and civilization. U.ntil re
            cently scientists have practically con
            ceded that the evolution of man as
            it goes on at present is not a contin
            uous process with his evolution in the
            past. In the animal world without
            man "higher" means with more phys
            ical strength, more differentiated,
            more prolific, more able to cope with
            natural enemies. If the word "higher"
            were used of man in the same way,
            the savage would be a higher type
            than the civilized man. As applied to
            man "higher" implies social depen
            dence, mildness and mentality. Dar
            win, Wallace, Spencer, Huxley, have
            all practically concurred in the view
            stated by Prof. Fiske in "the Destiny
            of Man" when he says, "When human
            ity began to be evolved an entirely
            new chapter in the history of the uni
            verse was opened. Henceforth the life
            of the nascent soul came to be first
            In importance, and the bodily life be
            came subordinated to it. Henceforth
            it appeared that the process of zoolog
            ical change had come to an end, and
            the process of psychological change
            was to take its place "
            It is only in the last few years that
            certain thinkers have perceived ,the
            duality of standard imposed upon the
            process of evolution by this conces
            sion to that development of man
            which Is not physical, and have fret
            ted themselves concerning it, propos
            ing at last, with sublime audacity, to
            unify the evolutionary process 'by
            throwing overboard as valueless all
            the results of evolution in the last few
            thousand years, since, in short, psy
            chological differentiation began to be
            of importance. Their idea is to meas
            ure man. his civilization, his art, but
            above all his religton, by their effect
            on his species, by the standard of
            physiology.
            Nietzsche is the foremost representa
            tive of this school of thought In Eu
            rope. He was professor at Bale until
            he went insane in 1889, and it is impos
            sible not to infer that his philosophy
            is merely the result of a life of disease,
            the sufferer's method of flinging his
            gauntlet in the face of destiny.
            An aristocrat, a philosopher, a poet, a
            brilliant and disdainful thinker, the
            first volume of his works as trans
            lated was the last to be written by
            him, and the trail of his disease will
            be everywhere visible in it to those
            conversant with mental maladies.
            "The Case of Wagrner" Is a disjointed,
            epigrammatic, inconsistent arraign
            ment of the great musician which is
            well worth reading, but which con
            vinces the reader chiefly of the author's
            incoherence. "-.-^Klt,.
            He vituperates through 'JJJjSGrS&ZQs
            of unproved assertions to-^jjJPeffect
            that Wagner is a decadent;^ h£, is al
            ways "saving- somebody^'-W'd&wbcates
            holiness— ''Holiness, the*' Idst Unjf the
            higher values, perhaps still s&n? by the
            populace and woman, the horizon of
            the ideal for all who are naturally my
            opic For philosophers, however, It is
            like every other horizon, a mere mis
            apprehension, a sort of door-closing of
            the region where their world only com
            mences." Wagner, he claims, ruins the
            health of those who listen to him. The
            proof lies in the fact that he himself
            does not breathe easily when listening
            to Wagner, and is not exhilerated as
            he is by dance music, or the operas
            of Bizet. He confesses that when he
            was younger he regarded Wagner's
            music as the expression of a powerful
            superabundance of nature. In the
            same way he regarded the philosophi
            cal pessimist of the nineteenth cen
            tury as the symptom of a "triumphal
            fulness of life." "I took tragical per
            ception for the choicest luxury of our
            civilization, as its most precious, most
            noble, most dangerous mode of squan
            dering, but always.on the ground of its
            superabundance, as its permitted lux
            ury." In other words, in the days of
            his own strength and vigor he per
            ceived what was really true, that it is
            only the great productive eras, the as
            cending eras of history, in which
            freaks abound. Pessimism is one of
            the direct products of vitality. But,
            as he grew older, become broken in
            health, jaded, fatigued, and began to
            decline toward madness, the things
            which had previously seemed to him
            symptoms of health and vigor began
            to seem marks of impoverishment and
            decay, and he conceived the splendidly
            insolent idea of arraigning human civ
            ilization in the stead of himself, and
            accusing religion of all the evils which
            are especially attendant on the lack
            of it. Few men have ever planned or
            carried out so brilliant and so hopeless
            a campaign, but in the valley of hu
            miliation to which he has gone down
            intellectually, there can enter no
            thought of satisfaction at his unique
            revenge upon the world.
            If it were worth while to arraign his
            inconsistencies, it wouKl be interesting
            to note what he says of Bizet's music
            in the light of the fact that his tests of
            art are supposed to be physical and
            not psychical. He finds that melody
            makes the spirit free, that it gives
            wings to thought, and makes of the
            philosopher a better philosopher." The
            grey heaven of obstruction thrilled as
            it were, by lightnings; the light strong
            enough for all the filigree of things;
            the great problems ready to be
            grasped; the universe surveyed as from
            a mountain summit. Answers fall into
            my lap unexpectedly; a little hail
            shower of ice and wisdom, of solved
            problems, Bizet makes me productive.
            All that is good makes me productive.
            I have no other gratitude, nor have I
            any other proof of what is good."— ln
            other words, the amount of intellectual
            stimulus a thing affords is the supreme
            test of its value — a contention which
            wculd come more gracefully from one
            who conceived of psychological evolu
            tion as the matter of chief importance.
            Besides his arraignment of Wagner the
            volume under consideration contains
            "The Twilight of the Idols," a number
            of iconoclastic papers and paragraphs
            in which the author of Soc
            rates and all the '"'great wise men" as
            "declining types/ scoffs at "Reason in
            Philosophy;" arraigns Christian mor
            ality as r.nti-natural; finds the German
            nation unworthy of consideration; set
            tles Renan, Seint Beuve, the Imitatio
            Christi, George Eliot, George Sand, Car
            lyle, Emerson, Spencer, and the labor
            question in a paragraph apiece.
            The Jast essay in the book is entitled
            "The Anti Christ; an essay towards a
            criticism of Christianity," and is a very
            curious piece of literature. The author
            posits a "real" world which is apparent
            ly a material one, though he is by no
            means a consistent materialist. Every
            thing which differs from this "real"
            world of his is not only false but cor
            rupt. Nietzsche alone possesses the
            touch-stone of reality. "Pure spirit is
            pure lie." "In Christianity neither
            morality nor .religion is in contact with
            any point of actuality." "Christianity,
            a form of mortal hostility to reality
            which has not hitherto been sur
            passed." God is a decadent, Christ is
            a symbolist, screams this strange phil
            osopher who is singularly unphiloso
            phic, who uses the language of Billings
            gate, and regards invective as argu
            ment. "I am" from Jehovah is base
            imposition. "I am" from Nietzsche is
            proper self-assertion, is the upshot of
            some hundred pages of raving. Chris
            tianity is antimatural in that it would
            take the world from the strong and
            give it to the weak. The world was
            meant for the few, of whom the writer
            is chief. Sympathy is a mortally dan
            gerous disease. To be sound is to be
            pitiless. To be pitiless is to be noble.
            The fact that the consensus of human
            opinion is on the other side is only one
            argument the more in the mind of
            this man for his own point of view, for
            the vulgar are habitually in error and
            to be against them is almost a proof
            THE SaINT PAUL GLOBE: SUNDAT, ytTLt 19, 18901
            of right-thinking. The Christian
            values are false because they are false
            to him; and because they are false to
            him, "Christianity Js the one immortal
            blemish of mankind."
            All this is very interesting, but it 1b
            not philosophy. That a man bo evi
            dently Buffering from the sense of ex
            aggregated self-importance which is
            preliminary to paresis should b« re
            garded as a "European event" and
            should give rise to an Independent
            school of thought upon the continent
            is somewhat incredible and could hard
            ly occur in an age less avid of some
            new thing than our own. Hlb neces
            sarily limited vogue is the only excuse
            for taking him seriously, and it is not
            on the whole a valid excuse. Wher
            ever the future of philosophy lies, it is
            not In the hands of this man. At a
            venture one might guess that he who
            shall show that even as evolution
            ceased to be physical and became
            psychological, so it also has ceased to
            be psjichelo^ical and become spiri
            tual Is the coming philosopher.
            His task will be less impossible than
            that of those who would overthrow all
            that evolution has accomplished with
            the race in the last few thousand years.

                  <text>Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, the German philos
          opher, the announcement of whose death on Satur
          day at Weimar was printed in yesterday's Tribune,
          was born In Saxony on October 15, 1844. He was
          said to be precocious as a child, having on one
          occasion deliberately burned his hand to show that
          Muclus Seaevoik's similar act was but a trifling
          matter. As a schoolboy he became acquainted with
          Wagner's music, which had a great influence on
          his after life. He studied at Bonn and Lelpsic
          universities, and at his graduation was considered
          a man of extraordinary breadth of knowledge.
          Although educated for the ministry, he soon re
          nounced it. and at twenty-six years of age he was
          appointed professor of philology at Basle, making
          a specialty of Oriental languages. While there he
          became Intimately acquainted with Wagner. In
          1876, however, while he was attending the Bayreuth
          performances, an entire change came over his
          views, and he became a violent opponent of Wag
          ner. From this is thought by many to date the
          beginning of the mental malady that wrecked the
          last years of his life. In 1S&0 he was obliged to
          resign his professorship at Basle, and for nine
          years thereafter he visited various health resorts
          in Europe, trying to ward oft the insanity that
          hung over him. Meanwhile, his literary activity
          was incessant, accompanied by an ever increasing
          egotism that made him say of his book. "Thus
          Spake Zarathustra." "I have given to men the
          deepest book they possess."
          In li&s he became hopelessly insane, and in this
          condition he continued till his death or. Saturday.
          His works expound a revolutionary philosophy, de
          nouncing all religion, advocating socialistic ideas
          and treating all moral laws as remnants of Chris
          tian superstition. His Ideal was unbridled free
          dom in the struggle for existence, seeking pleasure
          only and despising pity. He wad strongly influ
          enced by Schopenhauer. A translation of his
          works into English has been undertakes. His
          book. "The Case of Wagner" (ISSS). is a violent
          attack on Wagner's music dramas and theories of
          the lyric drama, combating them as warm. as he

              Wagner is all that we had hoped of him: a
              great md lavish mind. an enonretio mtnd, and
              an entraneingly amiable man.

              to me the likeness of what Schopenhauer calls
              "the genina." This is no other than Richard

              menl that appears in the press, the writmgs of
              muslcal ptdants. etc. No one knows him, no one
              cHn judge him, for all the world stands on an
              >:h. r foundation and is not native to his atmoa
              phere. In him there reigns so unconditional an
              ideality, so deep and touching a humanity. so
              subHme an earnestness of life, that near him I
              feel myself in neighborhood of the divine.

              have been a quarrel over Brahms. At any r

              drew from these marks of esteem wherever he

              Altogether too Human"), ln which he began to
              lampoon his former master. In 1888 came "Der

              over poor Nietzsche's mind forever. There ls
              evidence a-plenty that Nietzsehe always con?
              sidered himself aggrieved and never forgot the
              intellectual debt which he owed to the early
              meetings at Triehsrhea Even after he had
              written "Der Fall Wagner" he wrote: "Here.

          "Man is a bridge and a goal." he says
          in one place: and, again. "Man is a
          transit and an exit." What Nietzsche
          aimeil at doing was to get rid of the
          idea of an absolute good anil evil and
          to substitute an Immediate sense of
          good and bad. pleasant and unpleasant,
          worth while or unworthy. The essence
          of Christian morality he mistook to be
          tiie desire of the individual to save his
          soul, and thus boldly stated, this seems
          a most ignoble aim. It is only when
          one realizes that what meant was that
          each individual should strive to sub-
          Iject his lower nature to his higher in
          tiie interests of all that fine sees that
          our western religion and our Teutonic
          philosopher were reall aiming at one
          and the same mark: To make of man
          "A DOCTOR FOR SICK SOULS."
          It Is unnecessary to point out how
          alien is Nietzsche's whole attitude of
          mind to the American temper. He ab
          hored commercialism, hunmanitarian
          isni. facile optimism, any form of cas
          ual, easy-going light-heartedness. The
          very foundation of his philosophy was
          to admit an evil world; to make no
          such slim excuses for it as that it was
          the best of all possible worlds whiles
          most tilings in it were necessarily
          evils.
          It was suffering and compliance and
          a broken spirit, thought Nietzsche,
          which had finally condoled itself with
          inventing a Heaven and a hereafter in
          which to store its jos It was a
          "an arrow and an aspiration after su
          perman "' Again, Nietsche objected to
          shifting the burden of improving' life
          upon God ar upon evolution. Man by
          deliberate choice and by imposing- his
          will was to create values and affirm a
          worthy life. This is the meaning of
          his proclamation in "Zarathushtra.":
          "God is dead. Now, men," he calls,
          "it is your time to make an effort;
          to create worth for life, since there is
          no outside help. The very roots 7f
          good and evil are in your own hearts;
          they are not in life. In chance, in
          luck or in the hereafter." The proc
          lamation is amazingly like one made
          long before: "The kingdom of-Heaveii
          is within you." Louise Collier Wil
          cox, in North American Review.

            Sheboygan. Wi.. J i 1:'-Ti the
            German philosorher Nietzsche and to
            the noted historian Treitschka must
            be attributed, to a great extent, the
            causes of the world war.
            This is the opinon of Rw. David
            Thomas. who is spreaihng broadca.st

            p themselves and their children of the
            present and coming generation from
            social and racial ostraciim such as
            the Jews have suffered for nineteen
            centuries.
            "We are today at war with the
            greatest militavy power the wind has
            ever known. It know s no justic.. nio

                    <text>The Ruling Superman Is Scientific Knowledge Built Up by
            the Millions and Controlled by Them.

            his friends, and only friends, an eagle and a snake.
            Excellent companions, typical of the superman's cre
            ator, Nietzsche, whose thought sometimes soars like the
            eagle to noblest heights and more often crawls like a serpent
            tempting to baseness.
            "I teach you beyond-man. Man is something that shall
            be surpassed," said Nietzsche.
            "God is dead," said Nietzsche. The will of the super
            man Was to rule. He presents the body of the people ig
            norant, stupid, hating wisdom, delighting in a rope dancer.
            The rope dancer falls; is crushed, and, dying, exclaims:
            "I knew it long ago that the devil would play me a
            trick. Now he draggeth me unto hell; art thou going to
            hinder him?"
            "On my honor, friend," Zarathustra answered, "what
            thou speakest of doth not exist; there is no devil or hell.
            Thy soul will be dead even sooner than thy body; hencefor
            ward fear nothing."
            There is the doctrine of Nietzsche that went down to in
            sanity, and there the doctrine of Prussia that will go down
            to defeat.

            Aside from that, traffic here is

            "I
            Nietzsche, no superman, but one brutally disregarding
            right and morality, died a maniac, when he hoped to live
            and dominate the world of thought.
            Prussia, dreamine of world conquest, of super-rule on
            earth,' will end as miserably as her son Nietzsche, the
            prophet of Prussianism.
            The superman that Nietzsche painted, the beyond-man
            ruling as an individual, will never be. The human rac?
            will be held down forever to that equality of power that
            makes for brotherhood.
            But on earth the superman dwells and rules already.
            He is made up of all the good, all the power, science,
            benevolence, contained in the combined brains of the human
            race.
            Nietzsche dreamed of beyond-man with an eagle for his
            slave. What would he have said of today's super-race, con
            trolling great flocks of flying machines, every one flying
            higher, faster and farther than any eagle?
            What would this oracle of super-selfishness' have said
            could he see the United States today building a fleet of ten
            thousand super-eagles that will take dynamite to Prussia
            and prove that the superman is named JUSTICE, not
            Nietzsche, Zarathustra, or Hohenzollern?
            Every one of us little human beings, working together
            on the earth, making it and ourselves better, century after
            century, has a right to rejoice in the existence of a super
            man. To show a giant pulling a tree up by the roots, tearing
            open the jaws of a lion, carrying five thousand pounds on his
            back, hewing his way through an army, such were the utmost
            thoughts of those that planned the superman of old Greek
            days, or of modern Prussia.
            The real superman is the intelligent, ordinary human
            being, plus science.
            A child two years old can pull a switch and with an
            electric magnet, using power invisible, lift a hundred thou
            sand pounds of steel rails.
            Man can build a derrick that will lift a battleship.
            He uses in his forges steel, electric and hydraulic ham
            mers with which he can delicately and accurately crack a
            nut or hammer a great sheet of steel into any shape desired.
            Nietzsche's beyond-man was to send his eagle flying
            through the air at about fifty miles an hour.
            Super-science sends its messages by telegraph without (
            wires at a speed seven times round the earth in one second, i
            Zarathustra called to his eagle in the air Man Bpeaks '
            to a ship three thousand miles out on the Pacific and in
            stantaneously receives his answer.
            The superman of science does more, and does better
            than all childish imagining could plan.
            It builds palaces of steel and glass over night
            city destroyed is rebuilt in a year.
            Super-science constructs a machine with a million fin
            gers to make cloth of cotton, linen, silk, and wool. It creates
            the machine for sewing, with a needle that flies faster than
            eyesight and frees millions of women from slavery. almost human he left me and i
            From oil in the ground science extracts the exnlosive 'h'n he ought to pay me for my
            force that enables man to fly through the air, rush over the
            ground in a machine moved by millions of explosions, plow
            his fields and cut down the forests with that same explosive
            power.
            The real beyond-man is the gas engine, electric sweep
            ing machine, wireless telegraph, submarine, flying machine,
            DYNAMITE.
            You know Nietzsche, the German thinker. He
            worked with the mentalpower of a dozen men, and died
            in the madhouse, having done moro than a thousand to
            start Prussia on its present vicious campaign of world
            conquest.
            He taught selfishness and brutal use of power, he
            preached in his "Thus Spake Zarathustra" of tho super
            man or beyond-man that should rule ill others, a giant
            bending the little people to his will.
            The individual Prussian liked to think of himself
            as superman and of Prussia as an all-ruling super-race.
            Nietzsche, marvelous in power, died in the mad
            house, and Prussia will end her disastrous effort at
            super-conquest in miserable failure and defeat</text>

            Just Arrived—Fancy Colored
            German Philosophy.
            The following report of the Min
            ers' Meeting in Philadelphia will be
            read with interest: An interesting
            discussion on the cause of the pres
            ent world war enlivened the meet
            ing of the Presbyterian Ministerial
            Union in the Witnerspoon Building.
            Tlie debate was occasioned by an ad
            dress by Rev. William Hallo(^i John
            son, a professor in Lincoln univers
            ity, who attributed the war to the in
            fluence of Nietzsche's philosophy.
            The history and racial pedUlarities
            of tlie German people and their out
            reach for world mastery in trade
            were also causes of the present war,
            the speaker said.
            The connection of German phil
            osophy and theology wit.h the war
            were traced. "Nietzsche,, standing
            at the climax of this development,
            was more thorough-going than any
            of his predecessors." the speaker
            said. "Treitschke had complained
            that the Germans, while creative in
            other lines of activity, did homage
            to a foreign religion but Nietzsche
            removed this obstacle, so that a
            German religion of valor and of
            force was substituted for Christian
            ity and thus the spirit of militarism
            could have free course 'and be glori
            fied. Others had spoken of war as
            a regretable necessity, but- Nietz
            sche taught that it was the duty of
            man ruthlessly to exercise his will
            to power, and so war became the
            highest of duties. Every atrocity in
            Belgium or in Armenia can find its
            defense in Nietzsche's writings. His
            doctrine of the superman became,
            in the popular mind, the belief that
            the Germans were a super race, des

        <text>Nietzsche's "Antichrist" Proves, on Reading, To Be Anti-Paul
            A Rebel's Outburst
            Nietzsche's lifelong Antipathy to Christianity
            Concentrated in "The Antichrist"
            FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE is one
            of the most discussed and
            most misunderstood philosoph?
            ic?! thirikers of all time. Pos?
            sessed of an extraordinarily complex
            and finely wrought intellect and of a
            remarkable faculty for literary expres?
            sion, his work is characterized by the
            double subtlety of the seer and of the
            poet. To understand him even meas?
            urably well is an achievement of no
            little distinction: It requires charity
            and broad knowledge and freedom from
            prejudice.
            Unfortunately most of Nietzsche's
            critics have been neither charitable
            nor learned, nor free from prejudice.
            Unlike most philosophers, Nietzsche
            had a habit of expressing provocative
            ideas in a provocative manner. As a
            result his works have attracted a great
            deal of unintelligent praise and a great
            deal of Ignorant and malignant ani?
            madversion. One of the most wide?
            spread misconceptions about the trend
            and significance of Nietzsche's thought
            is amusingly illustrated by the follow?
            ing anecdote told by Mr. H. L. Mencken
            in his introduction to a new edition of
            "The Antichrist" ( Knopf) ^
            The "Monster, Nietzsky"
            "On the strength of the fact that I
            had published a book on Nietzsche in
            1900, six years after his death, I was
            called upon by agents of the Depart?
            ment of Justice, elaborately outfitted
            with badges, to meet the charge that
            I was an Intim?t* associate and agent
            of the German monster, Nietzsky.' I
            quote the oficial prosas verbal, an In?
            dignant, but often misspelled, docu?
            ment."
            Probably moat educated Americans,
            unlike the Department of Justice, know
            that Nietzsche has been dead for some
            twenty years and know how to spell
            his name. But many people who ought
            to know better still insist, perhaps for
            the sake of euphony, on grouping him
            with (he two conventional apostles of
            Prussian militarism, Treitschke and
            Bernhardt Now, it is doubtful whether
            a man ever lived more devoid of na?
            tionalist feeling than Friedrich Nietz?
            sche. Far from being proud of hi a
            German origin, he did his best, in
            spite of the genealogical records, to
            prove himself a Pole. He lived most
            of his life in Switzerland and Italy.
            He never for a moment shared the de?
            lusion that the modern Germane were
            a superior race, fitted to conquer and
            dominate the world. On the contrary,
            his writings abound in bitter strictures
            against German stupidity, and he de?
            lighted in drawing contrasts between
            German and French culture, much to
            the disadvantage of the former. His
            infrequent references to biB supposed
            colleague, Treitschke, are couched in
            Anything but complimentary language,
            rom the viewpoint of Anglo-Saxon
            morality Nietzsche has enough sins to
            answer for without loading him down
            with an association with Prussian mili?
            tarism, which he would be the first to
            repudiate.
            Not Wholly Greek
            Mr. .Mencken describes Nietzsche as
            "a Greek born two thousand years too
            late." This is true, but it in not the
            whole truth. The Greek element in
            Nietzsche was very strong, and accounts
            for his hearty contempt for such Chris?
            tian doctrines as sin, redemption and
            the purification of the soul through
            the mortification of the body. Among
            the civilized races of antiquity the
            Greeks were perhaps the most intellect?
            ual, the least spiritual, the least in?
            clined to console themselves for the
            misfortunes of this life by conjuring
            up visions of other worldly bliss.
            But no Greek of the fifth century
            B. C. would have been likely to dis?
            play Nietzsche's fanatical intensity in
            attacking religion. By a curious para?
            dox the philosopher's long line of pious
            ancestors (his forefathers for several
            generations were Lutheran pastors)
            may fairly be held responsible for his
            most violent diatribes against Christi?
            anity. Take the sentences of wild de?
            nunciation that appear near the end of
            "The Antichrist":
            "I condemn Christianity; I bring
            against the Christian Church the most
            terrible of all the accusations that an
            accuser has ever had in his mouth. It
            Is, to me, the greatest of all imaginable
            corruptions; it seeks to work the ulti?
            mate corruption, the worst possible cor?
            ruption. The Christian Church has left
            nothing untouched by Its depravity; it
            has turned every value into worthless
            neos, and every truth into a lie, and
            every integrity into baseness of soul."
            This is not the language of a con?
            vinced skeptic, but of a perverted
            evangelist, turning the batteries of his
            moral earnestness against something
            which he believes to be false. Despite
            all his expressed contempt for Chris?
            tian asceticism, Nietzsche, in his own
            "??v, is a good deal of an ascetic him?
            self, a St. Simon Stylites of atheism.
            He is never more sincere, more impas?
            sioned than when he is setting forth
            the dangers and hardships of the intel?
            lectual life. So, denouncing faith as an
            easy means of evading the responsibili
            tles of intellectual integrity, he says:
            Faith Denounced.
            "Man has bad to fight for every atom
            of the truth, and has had to pay for
            it almost everything that the heart,
            that human love, that human trust
            cling to. Greatness of soul is needed
            for this business; the service of truth
            is the hardest of all services. "What,
            then, is the meaning of integrity in
            things intellectual? It means that a
            mas must be severe with his own heart,
            that he must scorn 'beautiful feelings,'
            aad' that he makes every Yea and Nay
            a matter of conscience! Faith makes
            blessed: therefore it lies."
            Despite its title "The Antichrist" is
            not so much anti-Christ as anti-Paul.
            Nietzsche maintains the theory that
            the original teachings of Jesus, teach?
            ings of quietism and spiritual anar?
            chism, wore perverted by Puul into a
            <
            creed of hatred and revengo, a creed
            that spitefully disparaged health and
            joy and exalted sidelines? and sorrow,
            To him Paul is the incarnation of
            priestcraft; and he lavishes upon him
            every abusive epithet in his vocabu?
            lary. Except for the last few pages
            the book shows little evidence of any
            mental strain or weakness, although
            it was written only a short time before
            the author's tragic mental break-down.
            As always Nietzsche writes bitterly,
            vehemently, passionately; but his anal?
            ysis of the spiritual origin of Chris?
            tianity, although envenomed with hos?
            tile prejudice, is supported by sound
            historical and philosophical scholar?
            ship. The charm of the author's style,

            admirably preserved in Mr. Mencken's
            translation.

            by the twin devils of sickness and
            loneliness, and always pursuing his
            ideals at whatever cost of spiritual
            suffering, without conceiving a measure
            of sympathy and admiration for the
            man, however much one may disagree
            with or condemn his views. And it seems
            appropriate that "The Antichrist," one
            of his last rebellious outbursts, should

            Thomas Mann Blasts
            Nietzsche Barbarism
            That Guided Hitler
            By Carter Brooke Jones
            Nietzsche's hypothetical superman,
            who served Hitler as a model, was ι
            called "the maximum' in barbarism"
            by Thomas Mann, the famous Ger
            man novelist, in a lecture last night
            at Coolidge Auditorium in the Li
            brary of Congress.
            Summing up Nietzsche's philosophy
            in the light of contemporary events,
            Dr. Mann said the 19th century in
            tellectual rebel had flashed across
            the sky "like summer lightning,"
            pointing to the dawn of a new time.
            Dr. Mann, who won the Nobel
            Prize in 1929, fled Germany when
            the Nazis came into power and be
            came an American citizen, dissect
            ed the German philosopher's genius.
            He pointed to the fantastic direction
            it finally took and the fundamental
            errors it compiled. The author was
            by turns scathing, dramatic and
            compassionate as he took Nietzsche's
            concepts apart and held them up ior
            the audience to see.
            Genius Involved Malady.
            "What made him die an agonizing |
            death on the cross of thought?" Dr..
            Mann asked, considering the dissolu- \
            tion of the philosopher in madness. |
            And Dr. Mann spoke of the malady :
            Nietzsche contracted when he ex- ■
            perimented with vice after a pious, J
            ascetic adolescence and early man
            hood. "This illness," said Dr. Mann,
            "was intertwined and connected with j
            his genius." which came to drift ;
            "into tractless wastes."
            Who, Dr. Mann asked, tried to
            put into effect phases of Nietzsche's
            teachings, such as the urging that
            the unfit be destroyed, the saying
            that life was not in need of justice,
            but of "unjustice?" The answer
            obviously was "the -Fascist Fuhrer."
            None who has seen the efforts
            of the Fasciste to apply some of
            Nietzsche's philosophy literally, even
            if he may have meant it at times
            ironically, can read it today with
            amusement, Dr. Mann pointed out.
            Some of Nietzsche's writings, In the
            light of what has happened to the
            world since, "appears today like the is
            talk of an excited adolescent." These
            included his idea of war as a selec
            tive process for the betterment of I
            mankind, a weeding out and a
            ciearsinr. tœ
            Quotes Oscar Wilde.
            Dr. Mann quoted some epigrams i
            which came, not from the daring 18
            philosopher who was admired by ! 1
            many "liberals" at the turn of the!ρ
            century and later, but from Oscar ff
            Wilde. These "might well have been t
            stated in Nietzsche's writings," the M
            speaker added. j||
            "This Τ realize is a sort of sac- ! Û
            rilege," Dr. Mann remarked. "Wilde !l|
            was a dandy, while Nietzsche was a M
            saint of immoralism."
            Nietzsche's "will to power," the Ρ
            chief tenet in his philosophy, came j|
            to take Its place "in the trashy %

                            Preiderick Nietzsche was born in
                            1844 and died in 1900. He had lived
                            long enough to leave a Philosophy of
                            war, which Germany is attempting to
                            put into practice today. We blame
                            -Bismarck’s “blood-and-iron” policy for
                            the present struggle among the na
                            tions; hut it was Friedrich Nietzsche
                            who expended a merely brutal phrase
                            into daring and capitivating philoso
                            phy, which has cast a fatal spell upon
                            the rulers of Germany, from the
                            kaiser downwards.
                            Take as a starting-point a book re
                            cently published and much reviewed,
                            entitled “Germany and the Next
                            War,” written by Count Bernhardi,
                            himself a German general. This vol
                            ume bears on its title-page as a motto
                            we of Nietzsche’s typical aphorism’s;
                            —“War and courage have done more
                            great things than the love of the
                            neighbor.” But this is not all; for
                            Bernhardi employs the ground-work of
                            Nietzsche’s philosophy to advocate
                            the wisdom and necessity of armed
                            strife. The basis of Nietzsche’s
                            arguments is to be found in a sup
                            posed lesson from the science of
                            fetology—namely, “Nature red in tooth
                            and claw”; and over and over again
                            does the philosopher turn to biology
                            foar instances to buttress his barbaric
                            evangel. “But at any rate there is
                            hope in the exact sciences, and most
                            cf all in biology.” Turn now to Bern
                            hardi; and what do we read? “War
                            is a biological necessity, an indispen
                            sable regulartor in the life of man
                            kind, failing which would result a
                            course of evolution deleterious to the
                            species, as well as utterly antagonis
                            tic to all culture. War, said Heracli
                            tus,, is the father of all things. With
                            out war, inferior or demoralised
                            races would only too easily swamp
                            the healthy and vital ones, and gen
                            eral decadence would be the conse
                            quence. "War is one of the essential
                            factors to morality. If circumstances
                            require, it is not only the right, but
                            the moral and political duty, of a
                            statesman to bring about a war.”
                            Thus we see a plain soldier impress
                            ing a modern science and ancient pa-|
                            gan writer in justification of his own
                            profession. "Where did the soldier
                            find his learning? In the writings of
                            Nietzsche, who was a student of biol
                            ogy and professor of classical philos
                            ophy.
                            The fact is that Nietzsche has be
                            come the bible of the military caste
                            in Germany. His dazzling rhetoric
                            and diction have glorified war into “a
                            thing of beauty.” More dangerous
                            still is the praise he pours upon the
                            class he calls supreme—the rulers of
                            the future —who are to be, above all
                            else, lords of war. It is not wonderful
                            that he has caught many impetuous
                            minds in his alluring net; nor is it
                            remarkable that his writings are be
                            ing read today even by the bellicose
                            tyrants of South American republics.
                            Let us now attempt to explain the
                            amazing philosophy of Nietzsche, and
                            in the process there will be discover
                            ed a parallel to the present policy of
                            Germany which is realty startling.
                            Nietzsche knew for whom he was
                            writing; and he pens thus: —“The
                            real philosophers are commanders
                            and law givers.** His ideal society
                            was a pyramid, with "the king above
                            all, as the highest formula of war
                            rior, judge, and keeper of the law.”
                            Surrounding the king are the war
                            riors, who are “the guardians of
                            right, the keepers of order and se
                            curity,” as also “the executive of the
                            most Intellectual.” Under this caste
                            are the medicore ones whose business
                            is buying and selling; and beneath
                            all are the drudges, who must be
                            policed and watched lest they should
                            indulge in dreams of democracy. Is
                            not this a counterpart of the Germany
                            of today? Yes, it may be answered,
                            and perhaps of other countries, too.
                            Admitted; but “wait and see” the sig
                            nificance of the social pyramid in
                            Germany particularly. The goal of
                            Nietzsche’s philosophy is the evolu
                            tion of what he called the super
                            man, and the founding of an empire
                            to be known as “United Europe.”
                            These twin visions have inflamed the
                            hearts of the ruling caste of the social
                            pyramid of Germany. Nietzsche con
                            ceived of the superman both as a type
                            and as a particular person; and the
                            completest embodiment of his ideal
                            he found so far in Napoleon, who was
                            half-superman and'biff animal. But
                            there was yet to 'arise another super
                            man of nobler birth, xiature,* and pres
                            ence than"-“the 1 ltttlV Corsican.”
                            Where would this paladin Appear?
                            Nietzsche did not say “in Germany”
                            explicitly—that would have been too
                            obvious flattery—but from his criti
                            cism of the alleged poor qualities of
                            modern great peoples, except the
                            German, it is apparent that he looked
                            upon the Fatherland as the birth
                            place of the warrior king and the
                            warrior race of men who were to
                            transform the face of the world.
                            Great ones might be found elsewhere,
                            indeed, fit to be enrolled among the
                            company of the supermen, but the
                            momentum which was to produce the
                            whole type of superman would flow
                            from Germany. One quality Nietz

                            knights must possess, which was not
                            possessed by Napoleon—namely, aj
                            clean life physically —and the worst
                            detractors of the Emperor William
                            have never hinted that he does not
                            fulfill in this respect Nietzsche’s
                            ideal. But, as will be shown, all other
                            moralities, such as we kown them,
                            were to count as nothing, and, indeed,
                            were to be held in contempt. The
                            first aim of society is the support of
                            the superman; towards that all in
                            dustry shall be directed: —“I love
                            him who liveth in order to know,
                            and seeketh to know in order that
                            the superman may hereafter live. I
                            love him who laboureth and inves

                            The warrior king and his warrior
                            race of men would conquer the world,
                            and, as a first installment, would

                            “More fresh air,” cries Nietzsche,
                            more fresh air, for heaven’s sake!
                            This condition of Europe must not
                            last any longer. Is there a single idea
                            behind this bovine nationalism?”
                            Which reminds one curiously of the
                            kaiser’s excited demand for “A place
                            in the sun,” just as the tearing up of
                            the treaty safeguarding Belgium, and
                            the frank acknowledgement of the in
                            fraction by the German chancellor,
                            imitated Neitzsche’s own contempt
                            for “bovine nationalism.” Does any
                            one think the parallel is being pushed
                            too far? If so, how can the doubter
                            explain this further fact —that from
                            the day of his cornation the kaiser
                            has steadily set his face against be
                            ing styled ‘“the German Emperor?”
                            He calles himself “the Emperor of
                            Germany,” and will brook no other
                            title. In other words, he belongs to
                            no nationality; Germany is in poten

                            over which there will rule only one
                            emperor. This matter of the kaiser’s
                            choice of title might be merely amus
                            ing, if we did not know’ that Nietzsche
                            again had pointed the way:—“Oh, my
                            brethren, I consecrate you, and
                            point you anew nobility: ye shall
                            become procreators and cultivators
                            and sow’ers of the future."
                            “Let it not be your honour hence
                            forth whence ye came but whither ye
                            go.” “Oh, my brethern.
                            not backward shall your nobility
                            gaze, but outward? Exiles shall ye
                            be from all fatherlands and fore

                            be your new* nobility—the undiscov

                            I bid your sails seach and seach! ”
                            Events have proved how’ the hearts
                            of the rulers of Germany have be
                            come inflamed by Nietzsche’s twin
                            visions of the superman and conquest
                            of the world. In themselves, these
                            ambitions, though arrogant, are not
                            ignoble. It is when we come to con
                            sider the moral sanctions which shall
                            entitle the superman to override the
                            earth, at the expense of all other
                            human beings, that there stands ex

                            tionary conspiracy in history. At
                            this stage, Nietzsche formulates his
                            doctrine of “The Will to Power.” He
                            knew that all nations recognized and
                            defended “The, Will to Live:” there
                            fore he goes further—not existence
                            but conquest is the lesson to be learn
                            ed. As usual, he takes his argument
                            from biology:—“Wherever I found a
                            living thing, there found I the Will
                            to Power: and even in the will of the
                            servant found I the will to be mas
                            ter. Neither necessity nor desire, but
                            the love of power, is the demon of
                            mankind. You may give men every
                            thing possible—health, rood, shelter,
                            enjoyment—but they are and remain
                            unhappy and capricious, for the de
                            mon waits and waits and must be
                            satisfied.” .... “Passion for
                            power is the earthquake which break
                            eth and unbreaketh all that is rotten
                            and hollow; the rolling, rumbling,

                            besides premature answers: passion

                            him.” Also, pow’er was to beoome
                            hereafter “the criterion of truth:” a
                            lie, in short, as we understand it,
                            was not a lie if it made for power. As
                            we shall see, this doctrine is no mere
                            variation of, or playing with, the
                            phrase that “might is right;” in the
                            mind of Nietzsche, as in the minds
                            of his disciples of today, and espec
                            ially in the minds of the ruling caste
                            in Prussia, it involved nothing less
                            than the overtuning of all the moral
                            codes of humanity and Christianity.
                            Nietzsche saw clearly that Europe
                            in general -respected a humanitarian
                            code of morality; and that the chief
                            custodian and advocate of this code
                            was the Christian church. Forthwith
                            he attacked the conception of God,
                            the teaching of the Christian church
                            and the virtues that are now recogniz
                            ed among men. We need not quote his
                            | judgment upon the conception of
                            God, of the doctrinal teachings of the
                            Christian Church, for the simple rea
                            son that in the ears of most they
                            would sound blasphemous; also we
                            can better bring the argument to
                            earth by quoting his pronouncements
                            where they refer chiefly to the vir
                            tues practised by civilized mankind:
                            —“The most general effect, the most
                            complete transformation that Chris
                            tianity has produced in Europe is
                            perhaps the fact that the man who
                            performs, social sympathetic, disin
                            terested, and benovolent actions is
                            now considered as the moral man.”
                            This transformation he regards as a
                            curse, and would have restored the
                            desire for power, the fighting, the
                            envy and so forth, which he believed
                            to be the marks of ancient pagan
                            Europe. “Pity” he decried espcially
                            as being the offspring of Christanity.
                            “Pity is opposed to the tonic passions
                            which enhance the energy of the feel
                            ing of life; its action is depressing.
                            A man loses power when he pities.”
                            Having swept ideas, religion and
                            morality, as we hold them, out of his
                            way, Neitzsche next proceeds to des
                            cribe the canons which shall prevail
                            under the sway of the Superman, or
                            “Higher Men,” whom he would have
                            to conquer the world. Very signifi
                            cant is the fact that he discovered
                            the germ of his new morality in “The
                            ognis, the aristocratic poet of Mega
                            ra.” Nietzsche found that this an
                            cient Greek, in defending oligarchy
                            against democracy, employed the
                            word “good” and “bad” as synony
                            mous with “high-born” and “plebian.”
                            Well, seeing that the Superman
                            were to be by birth and interllect
                            the aristocrats of Europe, it followed
                            that the new tables of m^
                            should be on the lines indicated by
                            the aristocratic pagan who had given
                            the clue. Nietzsche .then drew up his
                            code of “master” and “slave” morali
                            ty. The “masters” were to be athe
                            ists and amoralists, enemies of the
                            conception of God and the feelings of
                            average mankind; but, on the other
                            hand, they were to be loyal, to their
                            own exalted slaves:—’“Profound rev

                            unwilling to renounce or share our

                            Regarding the “slaves'* Nietzsche
                            is not so explicit. He would allow
                            them to remain in their ignorance
                            worshipping God, because, among the
                            folks who “exist for service and gene

                            there would be left to the “slaves”

                            ness.” That is, the atheists Superman
                            is entitled to take the name of God
                            upon his lips when addressing the
                            multitude, while at the same time
                            he hurls from his hand the thunder
                            bolts of war.
                            Just here It may be asked in which
                            class Nietsche would place Britons
                            who “never shall be slaves.” Is Is
                            sufficient to recall merely this, that
                            the British, being largely a commer
                            cial people, are In general beneath
                            the castes comprising the Supermen;
                            and would make most serviceable
                            “hewers of wood and drawers of
                            water.” The Supermen, having found
                            ed “the United States of Europe,”
                            would next, supported by British
                            commerce, proceed to the conquest of
                            the world. Admiral Mahan, of Ameri
                            ca, hinted at this project in his re
                            cent article advocating the cause of
                            Britain in this war.
                            Let us now gather up some of the
                            points made:—(l) The Supermen are
                            a military caste, presumably emanat
                            ing from Germany; (2) their goal is
                            the founding of “the United States of
                            Europe,” and thereafter the conquest
                            of the globe; (3) in order to justify
                            their enterprise, they would destroy
                            all conceptions of Christianity and
                            the virtues of humanity; (4) they
                            would Invent anew morality, based
                            upon the respective rights of “mast
                            ers” and “slaves.”
                            What now becomes clear? That
                            this war is truly Armageddon, “the
                            struggle between the powers of good
                            and of evil.” Something else' also be
                            comes clear —namely, that there Is
                            no reason for wonder in the fact that
                            German statesmen break their words,
                            seeing that in their view power is
                            “the criterion of truth” and national
                            ism is “bovine;” also, that the offi
                            cial German military Gazette means
                            what it says—“ Woe to the vanquish
                            ed.” There was more than rhetoric
                            in the description by a prominent
                            French journalist when he wrote of
                            “barbarians rushing against civiliza
                            tion.”
                            The problem that next presented
                            itself to Nietzsche’s mind vras how
                            best to bring about the great enter
                            prise; and this is his answer—“ The
                            changes and transformations which
                            have hitherto taken place in morals
                            were caused by successful crimes.”
                            By the force of his own argument he
                            now necessarily praises war: that is
                            to be “the successful crime” which
                            shall usher in the new mankind and
                            the new morality of “master” and
                            “slaves:” "war and courage have done
                            more great things than charity. What
                            is the good? ye ask. To be brave is
                            good. Live your life of obedience

                            red war,” hnd his is the siren set
                            luring to destruction. How deeply hi
                            panegyric of devastation has infected
                            the mind of General Bernhardi has
                            been already shown: and Bernhardi
                            •is only one in the Superman Pen-
                            Germanic ring of “blood and iron”
                            which surrounds the Kaiser’s throne.
                            European morals being still of a
                            Christian or civilized order, Nietzsche
                            must needs look, or pretend to look,
                            for a plausible pretext which shall
                            permit the Superman to throw out
                            his challenge; and he points to an at
                            tack upon Russia, primitive and colos

                            the real end out of sight. The real
                            end, as we have seen, was the des
                            troying of present civilization and the
                            planting of the race of Supermen “in
                            the lands of the remotest seas.”
                            Colonies! Unboubtedly. French
                            Colonies today; British Colonies to
                            morrow; or both at the same time.
                            Nietzsche taught Germany to believe
                            that she could crush the British peo
                            ple—“A ' fundamentally medicore

                            from Shakespeare down, are “mud
                            dle-headed,” and so on.
                            Fed upon such stuff, the warmon
                            gers of Germany prepared for and en
                            tered upon their present task. No
                            doubt they thought the hazard suffi
                            ently perilous; but Neitzsche thought
                            so too; yet he advised them to take
                            the risk—“Man is a rope stretched
                            between the animal and the Super
                            man —a 1 rope over an abyss. A
                            dangerous crossing, a dangerous war
                            faring, a dangerous looking-back, a
                            dangerus trembling and halting.”
                            Nevertheless, he urges the command,
                            “Forward,” and shouts to his Super
                            man three watch-words —-“Courage*”
                            “Hope,” “Illusions.” The last is the
                            most interesting—“ln the present
                            state of knowledge, illusions, logical
                            fiction, false opinions (to which syn
                            thetic judgment apriori belong) are
                            the most indispensable to us; often
                            more than truth they are life-further

                            ing, perhaps species-rearing.”
                            Well, the rope over the abyss is
                            Germany’s million of soldiers. Over
                            the backs of these ordinary men do
                            the Supermen essay to enter into a
                            new world —or fall into the abyss.
                            One word more. Nietzsche died
                            mad; he imagined himself at succes
                            sive periods in his “last phase” to be,
                            first, a notorious murderer; second,
                            King of Italy; and, last of all, God.

                            En Nietzsche hay dos personalidades
                            ■bien definidas: el artista y el filósofo.
                            El primero es “europeo”: el segundo

                            por completo á la filosofía, y aquí surge

                            la vitalidad de su pueblo. Y al mismo
                            tiempo que Bismarck proclamaba como
                            “el primer derecho la fuerza”, Nietzs

                            Entonces escribe “Así hablaba Zarat
                            liustra”, libro que no es otra cosa que

                            de que la fuerza va creciendo, de que se

                            fía de Nietzsche es, pues, esencialmen
                            te alemana., y en nada se diferencia de
                            la Fichte, de la Freitschte, de la von
                            Berñhardi, porque esa, y no otra, es la
                            filosofía alemana: un idealismo que tie
                            ne por base la energía y la voluntad.
                            Es un error decir que Nietzsche no

                            porque Nietzsche quiso ser músico y
                            Wagner se burló de él. Sostuvieron una

                            No puede ser, pues, esa obra la que
                            refleje la alta mentalidad de Nietzsche.

                            Why should we subscribe to a Third
                            Liberty Loan?
                            Why should the United States be in
                            the world war at all?
                            Do the people of Germany, and those
                            of the Teutonic alliance generally,
                            sympathize with the aims and pur
                            poses of the German government? Or
                            are they simply bowing to conditions
                            they are unable to mend—yielding un
                            willing assent to a war they would
                            not wage if they could have their way?
                            What really caused the war? When
                            may the world hope for its ending?
                            All these and hundreds of other kin
                            dred questions have been answered,
                            and are daily being answered, in a
                            dozen different ways. For ibe most
                            part, the answers are based upon su
                            perficial and very partial aspects of
                            the matter, and are, necessarily, only
                            partly satisfactory and partly true.
                            If we would really understand the
                            significance of the world war we must
                            delve among certain musty manu

                            development of this fearful philosophy
                            and to identify the channels through
                            which it has been transmitted from
                            great antiquity. For it had its roots

                            tioning only two or three philosophers
                            of comparatively recent times. These
                            are cited, not so much for what they
                            originated as because they gathered
                            into definite and transmissible form so
                            many of these iconoclastic doctrines
                            which, maturing slowly beneath the
                            surface of German thought, were des
                            tined to find their ultimate expression
                            in the writings of Frederick Nietzsche.
                            Iniquity knows no fatherland. Hence
                            it need cause no surprise that one of

                            man origin. In Niccolo Machiavelli,
                            an Italian courtier of the Renaissance,
                            appeared the unblushing champion of
                            such brazen intrigue as startled even
                            the most unscrupulous diplomats of

                            to make them acceptable to any but an
                            avowedly unprincipled people. Yet
                            Machiavelli’s precepts, so softened, un

                            least, to break down lingering scrupu
                            lousness and to breed contempt for
                            the moral law.
                            In Schopenhauer Nietzsche found
                            his earliest master; and, although he
                            parted from him Later on, it is to
                            Schopenhauer, principally, that he owes
                            his characteristic doctrine of the Will
                            to Power. In Schopenheur, it is true,
                            this was merely the Will to Live.
                            Nietzsche carried that doctrine to its
                            logical conclusion—if the Machiavel

                            w, Schopenhauer perceived that the Will

                            for Nietzsche. His was not the type

                            There was but one logical develop
                            ment for a man of Nietzsche’s type,
                            given such a starting point. He be
                            came the supreme egoist of all ages;
                            and in his blaring egotism crystallized
                            Into definite and coherent propositions
                            all those errant and rebellious eccen
                            tricities which had Characterized Ger
                            man thought. He gave to the Germanic
                            philosophy its full and final expres
                            sion.
                            It was thus that Germany found in
                            Friederich Nietzsche the fitting
                            spokesman for all apostles of brutal
                            ity. He became at once the heir and
                            the administrator of all revolts against
                            delicacy and decency. He was com
                            mitted, absolutely and wholehearted
                            ly, to iconoclasm. These revolutionary
                            tendencies had long sheltered in the
                            shadows of the German universities;
                            and it remained only for later days to
                            bring forth one who might declare
                            them "as one having authority.” In
                            the half-mad, ego-ridden Nietzsche,
                            with his brain of lava and his pen of
                            flame, Germanic philosophy found its
                            spokesman.
                            To other peoples Nietzsche was
                            merely a phenomenon. His writings
                            were to be read and admired for their
                            thunderous and flaming rhetoric. They
                            were not to be accepted literally; they
                            were too subversive of all that civiliza
                            tion stood for. No man, it was felt,
                            could so write of these things and real
                            ly mean exactly what he wrote. A le
                            gion of reviewers swarmed over his
                            books, adapting, construing, interpret
                            ing, each according to his own fancy,
                            the passionate fulminations of this
                            past master of invective.
                            But to Germany, or at least to the
                            leaders of German thought, Nietzsche
                            spake as a prophet. In their ears his
                            scathing doctrines became, not rhet
                            oric, but religion. And his vision of
                            the superman, ruthless, hard, taking
                            without scruple, injuring without
                            qualm, a law unto himself—this was
                            the false god after which Germany
                            went avidly astray.
                            “In our present civilized world,"
                            declared Nietzsche, “we know only the
                            DEGENERATE criminal . . . the
                            criminal who distrusts himself, who
                            often seeks to belittle and excuse his
                            act; and we try to forget that EVERY
                            GREAT MAN WAS A CRIMINAL,
                            only not in miserable style bur in
                            great style. We forget that EVERY
                            [GREAT ACT IS A CRIME.”
                            And so we find our iconoclast, who
                            began with accepting Schopenhauer's
                            harmless Will to Live, evolving the
                            Will to Power. He no longer holds
                            merely that "self-preservation is na
                            ture's first law;” he proclaims that it
                            is right and lawful that he who can
                            shall take whatever he will—provided
                            only that it adds to and does not de
                            tract from his ability to take yet more
                            ruthlessly whatever his neighbor may
                            have that pleases his sovereign fancy.
                            Nietzsche had reached the point where
                            he held himself above the moral law
                            and reversed, or tried to reverse, all
                            accepted standards of right and
                            wrong.
                            Nor did he cease with this; for the
                            prophet, perforce, must justify his
                            prophecy. In the closing chapter of his
                            book. “Der Anti-Christ.” he scaled the
                            very summit of blasphemous presump
                            tion and gave free and final rein to
                            his furious invective. Here lie writes.

                            least. He has words of admiration,
                            indeed, for that warrior nation which
                            came flaming out of Egyptian bondage
                            to the conquest of Palestine; this ac
                            corded with his ideal superman. But I

                            contempt. And his dissertation upon
                            the origin of morality, as taught by
                            Jewish history, is one of the most
                            characteristically Nietzschean of all
                            that, he has written.
                            In the last analysis, Nietzsche taught
                            a dual system of morality—a master
                            morality for his beloved superman and
                            a slave morality for the masses who
                            were too impotent, too spiritless or too
                            foolish to make headway against the
                            predatory proclivities of their masters.
                            And in the earlier Hebrew, the man
                            of war and conquest, swarming into a

                            his own by the edge of his sword
                            putting its men, women and children
                            to a bloody death—he beheld his su

                            courage, ruthlessness, ferocity, because
                            these things contributed to the exer

                            But when the Jews were carried into
                            captivity—when they were no longer
                            masters, but slaves—the reversed con
                            ditions of their lot (reasoned Niet
                            ssche) reversed for them the defini
                            tion of God. Resort to the sword bo
                            came, then, the worst thing in the
                            world for them; it meant extermina
                            tion. Unable to combat their masters j
                            with the sword, they resorted to the
                            supreme weapon of the slave (as Niet
                            zsche styles it); they adopted the
                            moral law as their instrument in the
                            irrepressible struggle for supremacy.
                            And thus the characteristics of cowr
                            ardice, timidity, obsequiousness—the
                            marks of the slave—were elevated into
                            virtues. They became love of one’s
                            enemies, obedience to God, meekness
                            of heart; and the suppressed envy,
                            malice and covetousness of these en
                            slaved .people were thus transmuted,
                            through the alchemy of the moral law,
                            into their opposite virtues. Thus in
                            Christianity Nietzsche beheld the su
                            preme triumph of the slave over the
                            truly great and powerful and good.
                            It is characteristic of the Germanic
                            philosophy, however, that in spite of
                            its terrific condemnation of Christian
                            ity it would not abolish this. Niet
                            zsche’s objections to both Christianity
                            and the moral law are based, not upon
                            their intrinsic qualities, but upon the
                            fact that they impose restrictions upon
                            the ruthlessness and aggressiveness of
                            the superman. He would even per

                                    <text>Fredrich Wilhelm Nietzsche, born October 15,
                            1844, was the son of the pastor of the church at
                            Iloecken, Saxony. He took his university course
                            at Ilonn and Leipsic, making a specialty of the
                            classics. His ability was so marked that he re
                            ceived appointment as professor-extraordinary in
                            Classical Philology at Basel while he was yet an
                            undergraduate. He resigned this chair in 1880
                            because of 'll health. After leaving his professor
                            ship, he traveled some and continued his literary
                            activity until 1S89, when he became insane. This
                            mental eclipse shadowed him until his death in
                            1900.
                            His first work, The Birth of Tragedy, appeared
                            in 187 2. It was the production of a literary
                            genius, but it attracted little attention. Follow
                            ing this he gave five other books to the world, and
                            the world scarce heeded the gift. His literary
                            activity extended over barely«seventeen years, and
                            he waited eleven of those years before he obtained
                            a noteworthy number of readers. The first of
                            his works that 'gained the attention which the

                            audacity of his thought demanded, was Thus
                            Spake Zarathustra. The first part of this work
                            was published in 1883; three other parts appeared
                            later, but it was never completed. The Nietzschean
                            books of principal interest for our study which
                            were published after Thus Spake Zarathustra are
                            Beyond Good and Evil, the Genealogy of Morals,
                            The Transvaluation of Values, and The Will to
                            Power. The last, a post-humous work published
                            in 1901, expresses in its title what was distinctive
                            of Ins Philosophy.
                            Nietzsche was first of all an ardent student of
                            the classics and a literary genius of high rank.
                            The German language is generally accounted in
                            elastic and unwieldy, but it was resilient to his
                            touch and quickly respondent to his moods. His
                            temperament and vision were poetical rather
                            than philosophical; nevertheless the history of
                            literature and reflective thought places him with
                            philosophers. And this, although he did not de
                            velop a system of philosophy nor subject any one
                            of the problems of philosophy to systematic treat
                            ment. Ilis writings are not shaped after the pat
                            tern peculiar to philosophical works. They are
                            aphoristic and paragraphic, and the logical con
                            nection is not always discoverable. Thus Spake
                            Zarathustra is allegorical and Oriental, not dialec
                            tic and Western. Ilis thought is not ratiocinative
                            and impassive, but assertive and intense; it is not
                            expressed in unmetaphoric form, but is often rich
                            ly tropical.
                            As a consequence of his epigrammatic thought
                            ;. d his hearty disdain of those who may differ
                            from him, he is extreme in statement. These
                            qualities give a captivating vividness to his style;
                            but they make interpretation difficult. This dif
                            ficulty is increased by the fact that he has appar
                            ently no care to preserve consistency. In many
                            places he decries the feeling of pity; but against
                            this, in The Will to Power, he says; "Pity for the
                            humble and suffering is the measure of the soul’s
                            elevation.” The interpretation of Nietzsche of
                            fered in this paper is, I believe, logically deducible
                            from his fundamental principle; and it can be
                            sustained by quotations from his writings and ac
                            cords with the interpretation given by those who
                            accept his philosophy.
                            As ordinarily conceived Philosophy sets highest
                            value on truth; truth is for it another name for
                            the reality of all that is. It is the longing for
                            truth that sets it upon search for the norms of in
                            tellectual, ethical and aesthetic validity. These
                            norms are the expression of reality. In its search,
                            Philosophy submits itself to the rule of ration
                            ality—not merely intellective, but also affective
                            and volitional. Nietzsche makes vehement protest
                            against Philosophy thus conceived.
                            Unreflective human activity ranks higher with
                            him than reasoned activity; he insists that instinct
                            is by right lord over reason. All good is instinct,
                            is a principle of his philosophy. According to
                            him the will is “the sum total of a man's in
                            stincts,” and “strong will is the orientation of
                            instincts.” lie protests also that there is no fixed
                            reality to be sought. There is no world of doers,
                            only a world of action. He says: “The ‘doer’ Is
                            merely a fictitious addition to the doing; the
                            doing is all.” He likewise objects to the assump
                            tion that we should be guided by the Will to
                            Truth. He writes thus: “Granted that we want
                            ed the truth: why not rather untruth? And un
                            certainty? Even ignorance?” Again, he character
                            izes the notion that illusion is less valuable than
                            truth, as a “kind of silliness;” and he says that he
                            is "fundamentally inclined to maintain that the
                            falsest opinions.are the most indispensable
                            to us,” and that, “the renunciation of them would
                            be ... . a negation of life.”</text>

                            If we would really understand the
                            significance of the world war we must

                            must read what the masters of the
                            Germanic philosophy have written. Wc

                            of this bloody iniquity. For, mediately

                            tioning only two or three philosophers
                            of comparatively recent times. These
                            are cited, not so much for what they
                            originated as because they gathered

                            Iniquity knows no fatherland. Hen

                            an Italian courtier of the Renaissance
                            appeared the unblushing champion ol

                            fiuence of a century or two, combined

                            for Nietzsche. His was not the type
                            of intellect that submits tamely , to

                            from him as to the conclusions to be
                            drawn therefrom. He held, on the con- (

                            To other peoples Nietzsche was
                            merely a phenomenon. Ills writings
                            were to be read and admired for their
                            thundering and flaming rhetoric. They
                            were not to be accepted literally; they
                            were too subversive of all that civiliza
                            tion stood for. No man, it was felt,
                            could so write of these things and real

                            And so we find our iconoclast, whe
                            began with accepting Schopenhauer'!

                            Will to Power. He no longer holds
                            merely that "self-preservation is n
                            ture's first law"; he proclaims that 11
                            is right and lawful that he who can
                            shall take whatever he will provided
                            only that it adds to and does not do
                            tract from his ability to take yet more

                            have that pleases his sovereign fancy.
                            Nietzsche had reached the point where
                            he held himself above the moral law
                            and revejwul, or tried to reverse, all
                            accepted standards of right and
                            wrong.
                            Nor did he cease with this; for the
                            prophet, perforce, must justify, hit
                            prophecy, In the closing chapter of hit

                            characteristically Nietzschean of all
                            that he has written.
                            In the last analysis, Nietzsche taught
                            a dual system of morality a master
                            morality for his beloved superman and
                            a slave morality for the masses who
                            were too impotent, too spiritless or
                            too foolish to make headway against
                            the predatory proclivities of their mas
                            ters. And in the earlier Hebrew, the
                            wan of war and conquest, swarming
                            into a laud of milk and honey and
                            making it hi3 own by the edge of his
                            sword putting Its men, women and
                            children to a bloody death he beheld
                            his superman, for whom God' was
                            synonymous with strength, power,
                            beauty, courage, ruthlessness, ferocity,
                            because these things contributed to
                            the exercise nnd realization of his Will
                            to Power, and gave him added great-'
                            ness and supremacy.- j
                            But when the Jews were carried into
                            captivity when they were no longer
                            masters, but slaves the reversed con
                            ditions of their lot (reasoned Niet
                            zsche) reversed for them the defini
                            tion of God. Resort to the sword be
                            came, then, the worst thing in the
                            world for them; it meant extermina
                            tion. Unable to combat their masters
                            wth the.sword, they resorted to the su
                            preme weapon of the slave (as Niet
                            zsche styles it); they adopted the
                            moral law as their instrument in the
                            irrepressible struggle for supremacy.
                            And thus the characteristics of cow-
                            ardice, timidity, obsequiousness the
                            marks of the slave were elevated into
                            virtues. They became love of one's
                            enemies, obedience to God, meekness
                            of heart; and the suppressed envy,
                            malice and covetousness of these en
                            slaved people were thus transmuted,
                            through the alchemy of the moral law
                            into their opposite virtues. Thus in
                            Christianity Nietzsche beheld the su
                            preme triumph of the slave over the
                            truly great and powerful and good.
                            It is characteristic of the Germanic
                            philosophy, however, that in spite ol
                            its terrific condemnation of Christian
                            ity it would not abolish this. Niet
                            zsche's objections to both Christianity
                            and the moral law are based, not upon
                            their intrinsic qualities, but upon the
                            fact that they impose restrictions upon
                            the ruthlessness and aggressiveness of
                            the superman. He would even per
                            petuate Christianity and the moral
                            law, as means of more easily control

such severe cold has been found on Arctic seas,

hianned balloons Bent up last winter in Europe
a temperature of 87 below zero was recorded.
With this preface one can partially under
stand a communication recently published in
"The Monthly Weather Review" and "The Na
tional Geographic Magazine." both <>f Washing
ton. R. C. Mossman, meteorologist of the Scot
tish Antarctic expedition, now exploring the re
gion southeastward of Cape Horn, mentions
his preparations for sending up instruments
wit>, kilos, but adds: "There is some possibility
of losing a record by the freezing of the ink, as
we have not tin newly Invented ink containing
tonsol."
As to what "tonsol" is the dictionaries do not
tell. Mr. Mossman is at present inaccessible.
Leading chemists in the metropolis have never
heard <>f it; and this is the waj in which Pro
fessor Willis 1.. Moore, chief of the United
States Weather Bureau in Washington, answers
a query concerning it :
We regret th.it there has been .some delay
in making this reply, occasioned by our efforts
to ascertain, if possible, some particulars con
cerning the substance "tonsoL" The only in
formation in the possession of the Weather
Bureau concerning the particular ink mentioned
in Mr Mossman's letter ... is that con
tained in the letter itself. An Inquiry of chem
ical experts and a search for references to the
substance "tonsol" fail to develop any further
particulars. Dr. Wiley, chief chemist of the
Department of Agriculture, informs u.s that in
very < old climates it is customary to add a cer
tain portion of glyc«rol or calcium chloride to
rtiks to secure fluidity, and it i.s possible the term
•"tonsol" may be a trade name for some of these
todies.
RADIUM DISCOVERERS.
Professor and Mme. Curie Are In
deed Helpmeets.
Paris, April 10.
The most striking and interesting personages
It ill' present moment in Paris are Professor
Pierre Curie and his wife, his Invaluable co
«<ljut«.-. who have devoted the last six years of
their lives to an astonishingly brilliant series of
experiments in the extraction and isolation 01
radium, the most mysterious and most costly
metal kntwn to the scientific world. M. and
Mme. Curie have provided science with a new
and most powerful weapon. The mineral, which
ha* become the great talk of the day, was dis
covered in 1898 by If. and Mme. Curie, who,
after long and complicated chemical researches,
succeeded in extracting from a ton of the pitch
blende mineral of Joachinistal, in Bohemia, two
decigrams of radium. The operation cost over
£::.<•<•(>. which is at the rate of $10.1100 a gram,
or $10,000,000 a kilogram.
To borrow ihe definition <>f Sir William
Crook* s radium possesses the "extraordinary
proportj ■•! continuously emitting heat without

sufficient heat to melt more than its own weight j
of ice every hour. Radium en. its r,i\s of its own
which have the qualities of X rays and of
cat hod ie rays, and is as active in vacuum as in
air. Uranium and thorium throw off analogous
rays, but of an intensity a millionfold less than ;
the radium rays. The rays "i emanations from
radium penetrate through certain opaque bodies
and make impressions on sensitive films m
closed wooden boxes. For instance, if a coin or
a key or other object be placed in a leather
purse and the purse put ii 'he dark on a sensi
tive plate, and a little radium be placed near at -
hand, it will be found that the development of
the plate will produi c photographs of the coin or
key, just as is the case with the Rontgen rays.
The radiations of radium rea< I chemically upon
certain bodies; for instance, they transform
oxygen into ozone, and they change the colors of
glass or porcelain t.. dark violet or brown.
Another extraordinary property of radium is i
to throw off rays not only of heat, but of light ,
like those of the plow worm or firefly. Indeed, j
th*» li^ht rays of radium are so powerful that it
has been suggested liy French scientists that in
this mysterious metal may some day lie found a
means of lighting cities without loss of energy
or waste of force. The rays >•: radium dash and
explode like minute artillery projectiles upon
sensitive surfaces, and '.heir phosphorescent
properties are astounding. The most puzzling
property of radium is that, as far as has yet
been ascertained, it.- properties of emit) heat
and light are inexhaustible. The great Mys
tery is how and where the ambient forces
needed to produce heat and light are absorbed
by radium. According to the laws of the con
servat'on and correlation of forces, heat, light
end motion are convertible, and neither Profes
«or nor Mine. Curie, nor Sit William Crookes,
nor any of the scientists of France. England or
Germany who have followed in Professor Curie's
footsteps, have yet been able to prove that the
incessant continuity in the emission of rays of
light and heat from radium causes any exhaus
tion, expenditure or diminution of the prop

of a gram of radium In
recognition of her serv

manity the reading pub-lie-

was made much of by our dignitaries ;
that tea degrees were conferred upon
her by our universities ;. 'that. Presi

tensive Investigation of mesathorium,
another radioactive substance enough
of this was presented to her to bring '
the value of the combined gift to $165,
000. But where ' this American radium
came from and how it was produced
la another story, which may profitably
be told In this connection. It is espe
cially Interesting, Inasmuch as the to
tal world's supply of radium Is esti
mated at only 140 grams (a gram Is
one twenty-eighth of an ounce). The
Illustration by comparison sshows how
small is this amount. The lower sec
tion represents that made by the prin
cipal American radium refinery,, the
dark section that made by ther Amer
ican refineries and the upper layer
that produced abroad. So, though
radium was not produced in the Uni
ted States till 1913, this country now
has made about five times as much as
the rest of the world.
Whue Mme. uurie, Dy aiscuvenus
radium, introduced a new conception
Into the fundamental problems, of ex,
istence, she actually produced very lit
tle radium, since she was denied the
ores with which to work. Moreover,
she gave It all away to the medical
profession of Europe. A very small
portion found its way to New York.
In 1911 the late Joseph M. Flannery
of Pittsburgh, who had made a success
"with vanadium as an alloy for steel,
devoted his attention to the produc
tion of radium. The ores of other
countries being out of the question,
he turned to the carnotite deposits
of southwestern Colorado, Prior to
the World war this carnotite ore had
been shipped to French and German
producers of radium.
Thfr mining' and handling of carno
tite ore In southwestern Colorado Is
attended with difficulties. The region
Is desolate and practically uninhab
ited. Water Is scarce. Flannery had
his troubles. He had to train new
men. He finally established headquar
ters at the only spring of clear water
within 100 miles; here the Standard
Chemical company maintains all the
offices for Its mining work, transporta
tion and supplies. Eighteen miles
away the company built the largest
radium concentration mill in the
world, through "which has- passed the
ore from which has. been refined more
than balf the world's supply of radi
um. Burros carry the ores from the
mines to the mill, and wafer and sup
plies to the miners. i
Mme.' Curie worked on European
ores which contained about one gram
of radium to every five or, six tons.

one gram to every 500 tons. More
over, the carnotite miner is a pocket
hunter. Sometimes the ore appears
on the 8-face and along rim rocks;
then extraction Is easy. More fre
quently the ore is found under a heavy
overload of other material; then reg
ular mining tunnels are run and dyna
mite is used to break the rock for
transportation to the surface.' The
pockets vary widely ; some contain
only a few pounds, while exceptional
pockets have contained 1,800 , tons,
First, of course, the Tcoeket ' must be
found. . Prospecting Is done by drill.,
ing in likely spots with Jack hammers
and with diamond drills. " Where the
overlay Is not more than 25 feet deep
the Jack hammer, operated, by portable
gasoline compressors and compressed
air, is the cheapest method of wont
ing. Under other conditions the dia
mond drill Is used.
Hamilton Foley writes for the Pan
American Union an Interesting ac
count of the operations of the com
pany and of the production of the
radium ' presented to Mme. Curie; the
pictures used herewith are among the
illustrations. He says in one piace:
"Let us follow the various opera
tions from the extraction. of the ore
to the nnal recovery of the radium.
At the concentration mill in the wilds
of Colorado 500 tons of ore are - re
duced to about 125 tons. In a pow
dered form this quantity is shipped
in 100-pound sacks, by wagon and,
where possible, by motor trucks, the
65 miles to Placervllle,' Colo. Here a
narrow-guage railroad takes It to the
transcontinental railroad at Salida,
Colo. From Salida it travels the 2,300
miles to Canonsburg, Pa., Just outside
of Pittsburgh, .where the company
maintains its concentration plant, No.
2. .
"It should be noted that at the mill
In Colorado, and In the operations
pertaining to it, some 300 men. are
necessary to carry through all the de
tailed work. Also, that when the ore
Is taken up by the Colorado mill,
there is only 1 part radium for every
400,000,000 parts of the ore; but when
the ore reaches the mill, at Canons
burg the proportion ia 1 part of radi
um to 100,000,000 parts of the ore. .
. "The task, ofthe Canonsburg men
is to reduce this mass of ore to , less
than a quarter of a ton, and" In such
a way that whatever radium may have
been In the greater mass will be found
in the small residue. This Is done with
regularity and precision, notwithstand
ing that In the elimination of the 100,
000,000 parts of undesirable material
the Canonsburg plant has to use 10,
000 tons of distilled water, 1,000 tons
of coal, and 500 tons of chemicals.
It should be noted in this connection
that whatever small quantity of va
nadium and . uranium there may be
In this material Is saved while this
final reduction Is being made.
"The actual recovery of whatever
radium there may be In the tons of ma
terial handled at these two great con
centration plants is made elsewhere.
When the 125 tons of material that
reached Canonsburg from the mill in
the, West have been reduced to 'less
than a quarter of a ton, this residue
is sent to the radium research labor
atories of the company in the form
of radium barium chloride By suc-
cessiye " fractional crystallizations, of
the radium chloride and, at a later
stage, of the bromide, most of the
radium Is obtained In a salt contain
ing over 95 per cent of pure radium
bromide. By still further chemical
treatment the bromide is converted
into the sulphate or the' chloride, and
in th therapeutic use of radium these
two salts'flnd the largost use."
Mme. Curie, several years ago by
general request fixed an int'ernatloiial
radium standard. This is deposited
in Paris and the leading cities of "the
-iporld ? have replicas of i It. . So now
$Ihnn, preparations are measured by
t-omparlng the electrical energy 'car
ried by their gamma rays with that
of tire international standard.- While
radium has still many mysteries, it
may be said for the benefit of the
general public that its energy appears
to be given off In three rays, which
are known : as the Alpha, Beta and
Gamma rays. It Is stated thaf the
Alpha and Beta rays are-electrical
and that the Gamma ray is rather a
vibration than a ray. The Alpha ray
is 'believed to comprise 85 per cent
of radium's activity; it travels with
about the speed of light 4nd has no
penetrative power. The Beta, ray is
about 10 Der cent of the activity,
travels with about 1-15 the speed of
light and can penetrate about an inch
and one-fifth of lead. The Gamma
ray can penetrate more than three
inches of lead; when It strikes a hard
substance it breaks up Into two rays
corresponding to the Alpha and Beta
rays.. ..-
It Is the Gamma ray that is used
in bloodless surgery. The Alpha ray
does not burn. The Beta ray Is kept
from the patient by a screen that alv
sorbs it. The Gamma ray seems to
have the peculiar quality of picking
out "useless or harmful-tissues for its
first attack; it will harm useful tis
sues only after -harmful tissues" have
been burnt away or dissolved. Radi
um is handled in lass tubes incased
in lead containers. Those who handle
It constantly usually get pretty badly
burned sooner or later.- Flesh burned
oy radium cannot be healed ; it simply
disappears and Is gone. One of Mme.
Curie's hands has been affected and
her general health has been under
mined by intensive wartime work with
radium.
VA gram of radium makes a' small
thimbleful. Its current price Is $120,
000. A gram is divided Into' a thous
and parts, each of which Is called a
milligram and sells for $120.. Physi
cians who use it have from 50 to 250
mlllgrams." The state of New York
has recently purchased 2 grams for
use in the treatment of cancer.
, With radium worth $120,000 a thim
bleful, how is it that the' dials of even
cheap watches can be made luminous
by Its use? It's this way: The lum
inous material on the dial is a com
bination of a most minute portion of
real radium and a special zinc sul
phide. These atoms are so small that
it would take hundreds of millions
of them to cover an inch. As each
atom explodes, a projectile too small
to be seen under a microscope flies off
andl strikes a crystal of , the zinc ox
ide. The heat' generated by the im
pact makes a flash visible to the eye.
As these explosions occur at the rate
of about 200,000 a second on the watch
dial, their combined flashes make th
dial luminous. -</text>

By DORIS' E.
RADIUM, tho rnrest clement In the
world, la rapidly becoming an r
tlclo of ordlniry housohold use. It
Is the most valuable metal .in tho world
ono gram, which Is ono-twcnty-clghth of
an ounce, costing $120,000 yet It Is used on
more than four million watches nnd on In
numerable 25 cent Indicating tacks. It Is
so powerful that if any ono1 were to. .live In
the same room with one pound of It the
flesh would be torn from his bones. But
there Is not a nound of It in existence, and
If there were It would not exist In such
rorm. Ynt despite ' Its power nnd value,
children soon will play with its by-products
ns toys, while their elders use It In a hun
dred different ways.
There Is more than uno youngster already
who will not go to sleep nt night without
having his pet bear with radium eyea beside
him. And corners of rocking chnlrs will
shine out warningly nt night, poison bottles
vll' glow In the dark of the medicine cest,
night marksmen will sight their rifles by
the aid of it, mariners will riu'. more safely
because of It and the late returning house
holder will 1)0 able to find his keyhnlo moro
readily in Its light. Motorists, miners, fish
ermen, theatregoers, hospital orderlies, trav
elling salesmen and what Is generally
known as the great public will use this
rarest of substances as casually as they
wind their watches.
In MilU and Mines.
ilow much commercial progress Is to, owe
,o radium can be measured by Its rapidly
'ii'Teaslng use In fnctorles. mills and other
plants. Many mining corporations have
adopted radium danger signals and guiding
arrows. Radium indicators are not affected
by atmospheiii oniiillon.s in i ic ulni
whlch would make gas, oil and electric
lamps useless. As long as there is darkness
radium is visible. And In addition danger
of explosion Is minimized.
The tr.nrlner has already discovered many
invaluable uses for radium. Especially is
this true in tho case of the man nt the
wheel. Electric lights, oil and gas are dis
turbed by sudden motions and by the cut
ting off of current or breaking of contacts,
but when the compass card Is Illuminated by
radium Its visibility is reliable. In the en
gine nom, too, the telegraph control ist
serviceable on foggy nights and In times of
emergency.
But it is the ordinary householder, per
haps, who ivlll find tho greatest happiness
In conveniences made possible by more com
mon use of the mo. valuable substance In
the world. A minute particle of radium
used In a tubful of solution will make thou

is especially Interesting. Fishermen have

which people from all over the world Hooked
to gain relief from nil sorts of miseries were
In reality radium baths, for It is now known
that spring waters contain radium and that
to this fact Is due a great part or then

Predictions as to tho future usage ot
radium border on the fairy tale, for In spite
of the fact that it costs more than $3,000,
000 an ounce and there Is less than a pound
of It in the world, the marvellous 'property
of radium makes this small quantity stretch
limltlessly In usefulness. For not only Is
the radium Itself used, but the radium
emanations possess all the radio- activities

i ADIUM. radium—more radium!
This is the latest cry of the
surgeon, for the curative pow
er of radium, especially for
cancerous growths, is now exciting the
medical world. But radium is ex
tremely scarce and wonderfully valua
ble. Gold can scarcely be called a
precious metal in comparison. Gold is
worth but $20 an ounce, while a simi
lar quantity of radium would com
mand the vast sum of $4,000,000.
What is more, there is every proba
bility of the price of radium rising
higher if some of the beneficent work
it has already done proves to be last
ing. Reference is made to what it has
accomplished so far in battling with
sinister cancer and to what it has
wrought toward a return to health in
lesser maladies.
Radium fetches today at least $120,
000 a gram, and the world over during
the last year probably not more than
a total of sixteen grains were extract
ed from the hundreds of tons of raw
material worked for that purpose. Of
this amount about three-fourths had its
origin in the United States, and yet
today relatively little of this new found
curutive agent is in the possession of
American hospitals, physicians and
laboratories. Foreigners draw the vast
bulk of the mother substance from
the mines in this country.
How to produce more radium is ono
of the burning questions of the day,
and this country is particularly inter
ested in conserving its resources in
this direction and producing radium
for home consumption. Secretary of
the Interior Lane proposes to with
draw all lands of the public domain
believed to contain radium that their
precious deposits may be secured for
the public good and not become the
subject of private speculation.
He has urged the passage of a joint
congressional resolution empowering
the president to make the withdrawals.

tlon the secretary of the interior would
be authorized "to conduct exporations

ing from such ores a supply of radium
and to provide for the mining and
treatment of radium bearing ores in
such manner as would best secure a
supply of radium for the use of the
government of the United States and
the hospitals of this country."
Secretary Lane points out that there
are only two grains of radium in the
United States at present and says:

This is the latest cry of the
surgeon, for the curative pow
er of radium, especially for
cancerous growths, is now exciting the
medical world. But radium is ex
tremely scarce and wonderfully valua
ble. Gold can scarcely be called a
precious metal in comparison. Gold is
worth but $20 an ounce, while a simi
lar quantity of radium would com
mand the vast sum of $4,000,000.
What is more, there is every proba
bility of the price of radium rising
higher if some of the beneficent work
it has already done proves to be last
ing. Reference is made to what it has
accomplished so far in battling with
sinister cancer and to what it has
wrought toward a return to health in
lesser maladies.
Radium fetches today at least $120,
000 a gram, and the world over during
the last year probably not more than
a total of sixteen grains were extract
ed from the hundreds of tons of raw
material worked for that purpose. Of
this amount about three-fourths had its
origin in the United States, and yet
today relatively little of this new found
curutive agent is in the possession of
American hospitals, physicians and
laboratories. Foreigners draw the vast
bulk of the mother substance from
the mines in this country.
How to produce more radium is ono
of the burning questions of the day,
and this country is particularly inter
ested in conserving its resources in
this direction and producing radium
for home consumption. Secretary of
the Interior Lane proposes to with
draw all lands of the public domain
believed to contain radium that their
precious deposits may be secured for
the public good and not become the
subject of private speculation.
He has urged the passage of a joint
congressional resolution empowering
the president to make the withdrawals.

Cancerous Growths x *

Liver Trouble Relieved,
and Even Arterial
Hardening Checked A
WREN radium was originally
discovered public Interest
was greatly excite by the
merely curious properties of this
substance -Its power of emitting In
visible rays which penetrated solid
substances, of rendering various
bodies phosphorescent, taking photo
graphs In the dark, of expending en
ergy without apparent loss and so
forth.
Then came the discovery that ra
dium possessed certain curative
powers. The first results were not
very convincing.' and popular inter
est waned.
Now, we learn suddenly, that
physicians and scientists have for
several years been patiently con
ducting experiments which finally
prove that in radium we possess the
most wonderful curative agent In
disease ever discovered.
Radium has cqred many malignant
growths which''were hitherto hope
less. It has brought back destroyed
body cells to life, It has exercised a
beneficial effect in diseases of the
liver and lntestlner?. nnd It Is now
even said to be n cure for that
bafillng disease, hardening of the ar
teries'.
In the early days of radium the
effects of treatment were very con*
tradlctory. Sometimes a marked
aggravation of the disease was ob
cerved, sometimes the radium pro
duced serious Injury on healthy tis
sue. But in many cases there was a
surprising and unaccountable cure
of a malignant gTowth.
The reasons of this uncertainty
are now understood. Radium emits
three kinds of rays," which have very
different properties. It also emits
emanations, but that is another
story. The three kinds of rays arS
called alpha, bets and gamma rays,
after the first three letters of the
Greek alphabet.
The most distinguished scientists
In the world, including Madame
Curie, the discoverer of radium, Sir
William Crookes, Sir William Ram
say, Professors Soddy and Ruther
ford as well as many physicians and
surgeons have been absorbed in the
task of studying these three kinds
of rays and establishing the differ
ences between them.
The alpha rays are the shortest,
having a length of about an -Inch!
They have a destructive effect on
healthy tissue. That -was why, In
early experiments, radium often
caused such Injury. The beta ravs
came next in length. They are about
an inch nnd a half long. They have
a stimulating effect on cell growth.
They are, therefore, very dangerous
when applied to cancers and abnor
mal growths, but they are useful in
other ways.
The gamma rays are the longer,
having a length of three Inches or
over. These are the rays that have
effected marvellous cures of can
cerous growths. They check the de
velopment of abnormal cells and
gradually re-establish a normal cell
balance.
The alpha rays are stopped by
glass, aluminum and other metals.
The beta rays are stopped by lead,
hut tho gamma rays penetrate lead.
A thin sheet of lead will, therefore,
protect the tissues against tho in
jurious alpha and beta rays. These
rays are also eliminated by holding
the radium at rbout two inches. Fil
tration through lead requires many
more applications than distance fil
tration, aB the lead cauEes a loss
e\en of much of the gamma rays.
Radium also produces a kind of
gns, known as an emanation, which
fills a receptacle In which the metal
9 kept. This gas causes bodies with
which It comes in contact to become
radio-active for a limited time. This
f 11 rnishes a basis for another kind
medical treatment. The radio
may be Induced In water,
hich is then drunk and exercises a
valuable curative effect in many in
tractable internal diseases. The
radio-activity may also be trans
erred to solid substances and used

worms were radlurnized they went
on living as meal worms indefinitely,

sisters and brothers, unradiumized,
progressed for generations, complet
ing cycles of beetles, eggs and meal
worms over and over again.
There are many ways of applying
radium. One method, shown in the
large illustration at the head of this
P^fu' c?nsists in preparing a paste
with radium bromide and spreading
it upon a metal plate having a long
handle. The operator, wearing a
rubber glave. applies this to the
tumor. The alpha and beta rays may
be eliminated by keeping this at a
distance of about two inches or by
interposing a sheet of lead.
The length of application varies
witn the case. Dr. Abbe speaks of a
case where he applted radium for
thirty minutes to a malignant growth
and it began to retrograde in ten
days. In another case he applied It
for twenty-four horn's.
Two other methods of application
consist in placing the radium in a
leaden tube, open at one end. and In
spreading it on a cloth which is at
tached to the surface ro ne treated.

veins increases blood production, im

nervous system. Radiuinized water
has a similar effect.
A piece of radium placed against
the head of a blind person, or the
head of an ordinary person in the
dark, will i-ause him to see light in
which solid objects may be distin
guished.
It is from Ix>ndon th.".t the definite
announcement of the efficiency of
radium in curing malignant growths
has come, although Americans have
had a large share in the achievement.
Sir Frederick Treves, the noted
6urgeon, who made his reputation
by treating the late King Edward,
announced recently at the Radium
Institute in Ixmdon that the emana
tions of radium could be used in
place of the original substance. The
Radium Institute is a philanthropic
institution founded by Sir Ernest
Casael for treatment with this ma
terial. It possesses more radium
than auy other institution.
"Radium gives off this emanation
constantly," said Sir F. Treves.
"The amount of the emanation de
pends on the amount of radium used.
The emanation practically never
weakens. The radio-activity of the
piece of radium from which it exudes
is inextinguishable."
As a matter of fact, It has been
estimated that an atom of radium
sheds one-half its radio-activity in
2,500 years. The emanation prob
ably lasts for something approximat
ing that time, although its duration
l'j.a3 not yet been calculated.
Radium emanations contained in
sealed metal applicators are now
sent out to doctors tnroughout Eng
land for_patlents who cannot obtain
radium or go to the Institute. A
gram of radium costs $100,000, but
the emanation is given almost for
nothing.
At the Radium Institute many
cureB of inoperable cancers or ma
lignant tumors "were announced.
One woman had an enormous sar
coma of tho collarbone. She had
been informed by surgeons that tho
only remedy was removal of the en
tire right arm and shoulder. A tube
containing 116 milligrams of radium
was imbedded In the tumor for
twelve hours on two cojisecutlve
days. "Within a month alf signs of
tho growth had disappeared. Now,
after tho lapse of six months, there
is no recurrence.

radium. The tube is placed in., a
porcelain receptacle containing a
gallon of water, which becomes ra
diumlzed. The patient takes three
glasses of this water a day.
At the Middlesex Hospital, in Lon
don, a great institution for the treat
ment of cancer patients, reports
show twenty-five cases of cancer
cured by radium. Sir Alfred Pearce
Gould, senior surgeon of this hos
Dital, says:
"By the use of gamma rays in
cancer of the breast 1 have seen foul
ulcers cleaned; some ulcers have
healed up entirely; I have repeated
ly seen small secondary nodules in
the skin and fascia disappear; I
have had several cases where larger
and deeper secondary growths in
volving muscles?, ribs, rib cartilages
or sternum have disappeared, and in
other cases such growths have re
mained qtiiescen! and stationary for
such long periods that I could only
think the radiations bad at least an
inhibitory effect on the growth."
Dr. Robert Abbe, seuior surgeon of
St. Luke's Hospital, New York, one
of the most noted operators of the
metropolis, before the recent Inter
national Congress of Medicine in
London described an amazing series
of cures of malignant growths by
means of radium.
"During ten years," said Dr. Abbe,

York, with Radium. The White Dots on Black Ground
Show the Cancer Cells Degenerated Under the
Influence of Radium.

had an inoperable cuycmoma of the
thyroid gland of the neck. After
three series of treatments with ra
dium the enlargement and hardening
of the thyroid disappeared. The pa
tient has now returned to work.
Most striking results have been
obtained from drinking radiumized
water. Out of 100 per cont of ad
vanced rheumatism cases -10 per
cent showed marked improvement,
30 per cent derived benefit, and the
remaining 30 per cent remained un
changed.
Walter A. Brady, the seventy-year
old clerk of Part V, Supreme Court
of New York, reports that he has
been cured of, a hopeless case of
hardening of the arteries by ra
diumized water. He was told that
there was no prospect of a cure.
Threo months ago he began tak
ing a preparation of radiumized
water put up by a Berlin physician.
"The results havo been amazing."
says Mr. Brady. "From an artei lal
pressure of 230 pounds, which is a
terrible one, my pressure has been
reduccd to 150 pounds, not far above
normal, and I feel twenty years
younger. My regular physician has
been keeping my chart, and ho is as
enthusiastic as I am."
The apparatus used consists of a
tiny tube containing a particle of
"I have been able to study the effi
ciency of these specimens of Madame
Curie's radium on more than 75ft in
dividual cases in private, including
250 epitheliomas of all parts; 180
carcinomas of the tongue, throat,
oesophagus, breasr, intestines and
other visceral organs; aO sarcomas
of the skin, parotid gland, bones, etc..
besides goitres, tumors of the liver
and mediastinum and a variety of
naevi, moles, papilloma, etc."
In all cases where he ha/l not ob
tained beneficial results "Dr. Abbo
said it. was due to error in using
the radium. There were three types
of results (1) destruction of tissues
too closely in contuct (2) stimulation
and harmful results, and (3) effi
cient retrograde degeneration of
malignant growths, with lasting
benefits amounting at times to a sur
gical cure.
Since he had understood that the
gamma rays were the cause of the
degeneration of tumors Dr. Abbe
said he had never failed to .obtain
beneficial results.
Here is an example of one ot Dr.
Abbe's many ca.ses:
"A young man had the upper three
inches of the right humerus entirely
replaced by a myeloid tumor ex
panding in lemon shape. Under co
caine anaesthesia a portion removed
by the Star Company. Groat Britain Rights Reserved.
showed mixed giant-cell and spindle
cei! sarcoma. I embedded in the
mass four tubes of radium (total 150
milligrams) for three days, so as to
irrad-ra-te and cross-fire It. During
the eight weeks following gritty bone
began to form in the soft tumors,
and then a bony shell formed. Dur
ing six months a marked increase in
bone and simultaneous shrinkage
has occurred. Notwithstanding some
central necrosis of the soft tissue, it
bids fair to recover Its bone solidity
and strength."
So wonderful was the regrowth of
normal tissue previously destroyed
by a tumor that Dr. Abbe put for
ward a theory that radium has the
power of restoring the balance of life
forces:
"In what does the beneficent ac
tion of radium reside? .This ques
tlon, with many others, still awaits
solution. ? We know only that we
have a subtle force, which, as far as
we discern, is a stream of rays
charged with negative electricity
with intense penetrating power,
capable of traversing stone, human
flesh, or solid steel with facility,
which plays upon the vital cells
(animal or vegetable) and alters
their rate of growth or kills them
altogether.
"What the vlt^l spark is in a liv
ing thing no one knows. It has been
surmised that life itself may only be
an embodiment of electric force. It
has been supposed by some that a
living cell continues its normal ca
reer owing to a balance established
within it between positive and nega
tive eleqtric force, and that an ag
gregate mass of colls in the body,
such as constitutes a tumor, may
result from their erratic growth
owing to a loss of balance of elec
tric equilibrium. May it not be rea
sonable to suppose that a mild ap
plication of radium emitting its dis
tinctive rays is thereby capable of
restoring the electric equilibrium,
while on the other hand a prolonged
and intense application carries the
balance to a destructive terminal
tion?
?"Consider for a moment that re
markable case you have seen of the
tumor of the eyelid. It had displaced
the normal skin and mucous mem
brane, and grown In bulk many
times the size of tissues that had
been lost in It. There was no sem
blance of an eyelid in the. mass
whose tuberous growth rose in
heaped-up masses on the skin, and
within, and on the edge.
. "A cross section would have
shown no vestige of former tissues
which were destroyed or lost in the
mass. Yet, when retrograde was fin
ished under radium action, behold
the normal skin structure, the nor
mal glands and eyelashes! The orig
inal cells were not destroyed. There
was a reassembling out of the con
glomerate diseased mass. Whence,
then, came the diseased cells? This
can be answered only by the as
sumption that an intercellular Invis
ible and ultramicroscopic system of
particles had existed with a life of
their own, constituting a network
holding the visible cells together.
This system, then, had itself taken
on an erratic growth and become a
sarcoma mass, engulfing the regu
lar occupants of the ground."
Dr. Joseph Mulr, of New York, has
elucidated a theory held by many
physicians now that the curative
properties of natoi'al waters, hith
erto attributed to the minerals they
contained, are really due to their
radio-active qualities. Whenever these
spring waters have been examined,
they have been found to be radio
active.</text>

RADIUM'S EFFECTS ON ANIMAL LIFE.
The Metal Arrests Growth of Microbes, as Shoivn by Experiments Now
Going On in Paris.
Paris. December 17.
Radium, that precious ni^tul discovered by
the joint research's of Professor Pierre Curie,
of the scientific faculty Of the Sorbonne, and
his wife, and of which only five grams have
ever been obtained, becomes more mysterious
arid phenomenal with each successive scientific
Investigation. It was Mme. Curie who, by her
own experiments, first succeeded In isolating
radium and olkcting it in the form of a pure
salt From ten tons of pitchblende. LroUKht
from Joacbinstal. in Bohemia, two de.i
grams of radium were extracted after a long
and delicate chemical process. The cost of ob
taining radium was estimated last year at
LSO.OOO franca, or $:) MJOO. a gram. This would
be at the rate of 150,0U0.<-HA> francs, or $30,
000.000, a kilogram.
I called upon Mme. Curie at her quaint little
house, near Montsouris Park, the other day.
Her husband had gone to London to attend a
scientific meeting. I asked Mme. Curie if she
had any additional revelations to make regard
ing the extraordinary metal which perplexes
FOUNDATIONS OF THE LOUVRE.
"SKtrsr jrar-a asawatf rs ~' — bs-bs
burled out of sight for two hundred years.
and balMes the scientific world and which defies
all the hitherto accepted laws of physics. Mme.
Curie replied that in addition to the exhaustive
paper that her husband read before the Royal
Institution of Great Britain on June 19 last
there had been no further important develop
ments to disclos?. Mme. Curie is a woman of
a purely and thoroughly scientific temperament.
She positively declined to be drawn out into
any expression of opinion or conjecture in re
gard to any of the practical results or benefits
to humanity that may eventually be obtained
from radium. She refused, for instance, to say
whether she thought that radium might some
day stive as a cure or prevention of cancer.
In response to such questions Mme. Curie
simply said: "Why, I do not know. How can I
tell? I am not aware that anything in that di
rection has been actually demonstrated!" Sir
William Ramsay's announcement that radium
gives off a heavy gas, which slowly changes
into helium and then vanishes, was mentioned,
but Mine, Curie, with cast iron devotion to
truth, would not venture upon any assertion
not supported by absolute scientific demonstra
tion. In reply to my question "whether efforts
were being made to procure radium in larger
quantities than heretofore," Mme. Curie replied
"that the Austrian government was taking pos
session of the pitchblende deposits In Bohemia,
which were by no means inexhaustible, and tha
result of this would be that the future cost of
obtaining radium would be very much greater,
than hitherto— perhaps twice as much." This
would put the price of radium at $GO.OOO,OO<> a
kilogram. The fact is of great importance in
connection with the statement made to me last
spring by Professor Curie, who said that the
probability of extracting radium under favorable
conditions from the pitchblende deposits in Col
orado was most promising.
1 asked Mme. Curie what experiments just
now going on In Paris were of the greatest in
terest. The emphatic reply was: 'By all means
those conducted at the Pasteur Institute by BL
J. Danysz, who is investigating the pathogenic
action of rays and emanations emitted by
radium upon various animal tissues and sub
stances."
At the Pasteur Institute, in the Rue Duthot, I
found M. Danysz hard at work in his labora
tory. M. Danysz is a Polish scientist, and han
for the last few years assisted Professor Curie
in many of his experiments with radium. Pro
fessor Curie supplied M. Danysz with titty
milligrams of radium in the bromure form, and
it is with this quantity of the metal that the
investigations at the Pasteur Institute are being
proceeded with. M. Danysz is a wiry little nan
of highly strung, nervous temperament. II. *
dark, dreamy eyes have that searching brill
iancy peculiar to abstruse scientists, lie la aa
Indefatigable worker, and derives frequent in
spirations during his laboratory experiments
from fragrant cigarettes containing the purest
Russian tobacco. On the table he had a large
glass jar half filled with soft, powdered sea
weed, containing a dozen mice of different
sizes, varying from two months to two yean i.i
age. The animals and insects subjected to the
radium rays and emanations by M. Dai :■ ■•
comprise rabbits, guinea pigs, caterpillars and
butterflies. Tests have also been made m Its
microbes of charbon.
M. Danysz stated that "the nervous centre 3
of the animals or insects were extremely ten
sitive to the effect of the radium rays or < :
tions. The intestinal organs were, on the con
trary, only slightly sensitive to the affects of
radium." It will be recollected that the effect
of radium upon the skin was first not!< • •<) bj
Professor Curie during his earliest experiments
with the metal. M. Curie, one morning alter
delivering a lecture, put a glass tube contain
ing fifty milligram:; of radian in his waist' oat
pocket. No particular leiwattSß was felt at
the time, but a fortnight afterward his - s kiii
at the point corresponding with the wal
pocket became highly Inflamed and painful, i ■•
wound broadened and deepened, and could not
be cured in less than live months. It was this
incident that suggested the epidermic ezp >ri
ments with animals and Insects. It was then
discovered that the action of radium on i..«i
nervous centres produced paralysis or death, ac
cording to the particular organism and depend
ing upon the length of exposure to the i
emanations. A remarkable character!

ill AND IIS BLESSING
10 SUFFERING HUMANITY
If somebody should come to you
•with a twenty-dollar gold-piece in one
band and in the other hand an equal
weight of a worthless-looking white
powder and ask you which you would
rather have, and you should reach
out and take the twenty-dollar gold
piece, you might lose just $3,611,-
980.00 by the transaction. That is to
say, you might lose that amount if
the little pile of white powder hap
pened to be a salt of the metal radi
um, but you probably will not need
to worry; for they do not carry radium
around in that careless way.
They do not sell radium by the
pound. One reason is that there is
not a pound of. it in the world. An
other reason i§ that there are not so
many people in the world, even sinco
the world has thade thi snew grist of
millionaires, that could afford to buy
a pound; for a pound of radium would
be' worth around $50,000,000.
Radium is sold by the ounce; the
last quotation at hand is $3,360,000.
Platinum, famed for its scarcity and
value, is $l5O an ounce. Radium is
200 times more valuable than the most
valuable diamonds; it is 2,240 times
as valuable as platinum; it is 180,600
times as valuable as gold. A cubic
foot of it would be worth $7,000,000,*
too.
Yes, radium is sold by the ounce;
but as the total amount of refined
radium in the-world is only a trifle
over three and one-half ounces, no
sale of an ounce at a time has ever
been' made. The actual basis of sale
is the gram, which is about the thir
tieth part of an ounce. One gram of
radium would make a small-sized
thimbleful and would be worth over
SIOO,OOO.
There are 480 grains in an ounce;
and at $3,360,00 per ounce, a single
grain of radium would cost just $7,-
000, and this is probably the basis
upon which the radium manufacturers
figure their costs and prices. A grain
is the supposed average weight of a
medium-sized grain of wheat, and
there are about 16 of these in a gram.
There are 110 grams of radium in ex
istence, of which about 70 per cent
was 1 produced in the United States.
t* • •
Radium is so valuable because it is
the nearest thing known to perpetual
heat. It is an element; but instead
of being quiescent like other elements,
it is in perpetual motion. It has b%en
compared to a volcano constantly
shooting forth stones and ashes. Scien
tists have calculated that out of ev
ery 30 millions of atoms of radium
one atom goes' off from the mass each
hour with a speed estimated at 12,000
wiles per second.
The discharge of these radium mis
siles generates so much heat that a
gram of radium ( a small thimbleful)
generates in 26 days enough heat to
raise a pint of water from freezing
to boiling. And this is done continu
ously, day and night, without ceasing.
It is estimated that 1,700 years would
fce required for a given quantity of
tadium to lose half its potency, so
That, to all intents and purposes, as
far as we human beings are concerned,
it may be said that- it is indestructible
and lasts forever.
Radium in its natural state is a
®®tal, if any substance can be said to
ave a natural state that behaves so
keculiary; but it can be hammered
into powder, covered with lead, dis
solved in acid, heated, frozen or melt*

appens to it. With the heat it also

It now equals tuberculosis*in import
ance as a cause of death. Moreover,
cancer as a cause of death is rapidly
increasing, while tuberculosis is grad
ually declining.
A single radium preparatiorTmay be
used in the treatment of thousands of
cases. Rays of varying intensity
emanate from the metal. These rays
are concentrated to a focus upon dis
eased areas and the healthy tissues
are protected from the burning rays.
In using the radium in the treat
ment of cancer the rrfdium itself is en
closed in a glass tube, which may in
turn be enclosed in a gold tube or a
silver tube and the latter enclosed in
a brass tube. The .heat-rays pene
trate-through the walls of these metals
to the surrounding tissues. Sheets of
lead are used to cover adjacent parts
f.o that they will not be burned.
In a hospital in which radium is
used, the custom is to apply it for
about three hours each week; and
while it is applied the patient is con
stantly under guard, and/ not allowed
to leave* the building. This is’ because
he may be wearing upon him severa!
thousand dollars’ worth of the metal.
Evfin then losses occur.
In one hospital a patient suffering
with the heat of the rays, and prob
ably in of the great value
of the appliance lie was wearing, threw
several thousand dollars’ worth of
radium down a drain pipe. It was
recovered with great difficulty.
In Chicago a $12,000 tube of radium
became unfastened in.a bathtub and
disappeared. In Philadelphia a tiny
gold tube containing $6,000 worth of
radium disappeared between two op
erations that closely followed one an
other. It was said to have been the
only tube not insured against such
loss.
•* * *
Of course every doctor in the coun
try would like to have a grain of
radium, so that he might use it in the
softening of scar tissues, the treat
ment of maligant growths, inoperable
cases of goiter, and such forms of
cancer as can be treated by it; but
not many physicians have the meaps
to make such a large investment.
The Mayo Brothers, Rochester, Min
nesota, famous surgeons, have one
gram, this being the largest private
collection; but their institution is so
large and so important that it can
hardly be classed as a private one.
A company of physicians in Scran
ton, Pa., has purchased for
three-fourths of a grain of radium.
This amount came enclosed in a glass
tube about the size of the lead in a
lead pencil, and a quarter of an inch
long. The glass tube was enclosed in
ivp>- tube, the silver tube in a
brass tube, and the brass tube, was
tightly sealed in a lead bottle. On
account of the great activity of the
metal it is necessary to keep it thus
enclosed . JThe package is kept for
safe keeping in a safe deposit box.
Realizing that the cost of radium
makes it beyond the reach of even the
well-to-do physicians, the state of New
York has purchased two and one
quarter grams of radium, at a cost of
$225,000, which will be used for the
treatment of sufferers from malig
nant diseases at the State • Institution
for the Study of Malignant Diseases
at Buffalo. Any citizen of the United
States will be treated free of charge
at Buffalo, but preference will be
given to citizens of New York state.
Wisconsin has followed the example
of New York state and purchased the
fifth part of a gram of radium to be
used in the same way. Like amounts
have been sold to Australia and to
Japan. >

Before the war almost all the radi
um in the world was obtained from
the pitchblende of Austra,and it was
the gilft of a ton of this ore by the
Austrian emperor to Madame Curie,
the Polish scientist, thaf enabled her
to isolate the element
Commercially speaking, the head
quarters of the radium business is in
New York city, in the hands of two
concerns; and six-sevenths of the ra
dium in the world has been produced
by one of these concerns. The smaller
of the two concerns is the one that
THE NEWSPAPER—"WHAT IT BUT A Map OP BOBY LIFE, ITS PLUCTU ATIONS AND VAST CONCERNS"—COW PER
supplied New York State with its ra
dium, and has its ant at
Orange, N. J. The larger pi ant is j O .
eated at Canonsburg, near Pittsburg,
Pennsylvania.
At the smaller plant, it required 625
tons of earnotite ore, brought, a cross
the continent in 21 cars, and an equal
bulk of coal and chemicals, extract
the 2% grams of radium which con
stituted New York’s Purchase. The
larger plant uses a low-grade ore,
mined in the desert region near vhere
the four states of Colorado, Utah. New
Mexico and Arizona join one another,
the only place in the United States, by
the way, where four states meet. The
ores are carried on mule-back 60 miles
to the nearest railroad.
It takes five hundred tons of this
ore to produce one gram of radium.
A ton of the ore requires to be treated
with a ton of chemicals and 30 tons
of water, and finally yields a quantity
or radium about the size of the head
of a very small pin. Expert mining
| engineers have estimated that these
! Colorado earnotite fields will produce
between two and three pounds of ra
dium before they are exhausted.
A rich deposit hf- pitch blende has
i been discovered in the province of
| Ontario, so that Chnada may soon be
i engaged in making radium also.
England obtained five grams of ra
, dium after the war by boiling down
; a number of her great guns. This
I amounts to about a heaping teaspoon
ful, and is worth in the neighborhood
jof $350,000. . It is kept at the Middle
sex hospital in a lead safe weighing
one and one-half tons.
Prance owns only one gram of the
precious substance; but Madame
i Curie, the discoverer, wife of one of
the professors in the University of
I Paris, has succeeded in collecting and
I saving the gas which emanates from
: the radium constantly, and it is fonnd
; that this gas is as effective in the
cure of cancer as is the radium.

gum.'} ly disease, is to
w come down from
its dizzy heights of
prohibitive price to
be made accessi
ble to many who
? are afflicted with
this terrible
scourge. through
the public service hospitals. After the
proposed new process is in active opera
tion the cost of radium, which cannot be
procured now for less than $120,000 per
gram, will be reduced from one-half to
even less than one-third.
This fact has been authentically given
out by the bureau of mines as the result
of the investigations taken up by them
since the establishment of the bureau to
determine whether and how a supply of
radium might be obtained within the
United fitates sufficient to answer the
persistent demands from the numerous
hospitals in this country for radium to
use in the treatment of cancer.
Radium is so rare that in all the world
at present there is probably not over
thirty grams, which in bulk is equal to
the bulk of a garden pea. This scarcity*
of course, keeps the price soaring in six
figure altitudes, since it is valued at over
a hundred thousand times its weight in

increasing, and the pathetic phase of it is
Chat the majority of cases are among
the poor, of a class that coald never se
cure for themselves any benefits that
might come from radium treatment at its
present* price.
The possibilities of radium in connec
tion with cancer have as yet barely been
sounded, for owing to the great scacity
'of this wonderful metallic substance,
which emits rays that render luminous
sensitive objects upon whioh they are
thrown, only a limited number of cases
have been treated. Not more than three
or four physicians have been able to se
cure radium for this purpose.
As there are at present estimated to be
300,000 cases of cancer in the United
States, and the average period of the
duration of the disease from the begin
ning of its attack and the death of the
patient is about three years, the great
bene.1t from cheaper radium can best be
imagined. Physicians and scientists who
have made a study of the radium treat
ment advance, from their necessarily
limited experience, the belief that fully
15 per cent of all superficial cancer cases
may be cured by radium, provided, of
course, that the disease is not already
in its last stages. But a recent report
from the Radium Institute of London
holds out even greater prospects for the
use of this marvelous substance. It
states that out of nearly 500 cases of ma
lignant cancer treated by the institute
during 1913, 80 were described as cured
and 183 as improved, while there are a
number of cases upon which there is yet
no report This institute uses radium
only as a last resort.
Cancer is not the only physical ailment
that may be cured by radium. It is ex
pected to be of great value in the treats
ment of Insanity, gout epilepsy, tubercu
losis, anemia and high blood pressure.

uranium, thoriun and their decomposi
tion products, all of which possess the
property of spontaneously emitting
radiations and of giving off a continu
ous supply of energy without apparent
stimulus or exhaustion. The emission
of energy by these substances cannot be
retarded or accelerated; the energy
comes from an unknown source, obeys
unknown laws and apparently comes
out of nothing. Radium, for example,
emits per unit mass more energy than
any sun or star. If the sun were all
radium it would give off heat and light
probably one million times greater than
the present orb. This wonderful ebulli
tion of energy by radio-active material
has enabled chemists and physicists to
discover elements that would otherwise
remain . unknown, and to measure
minute qnantity of their elements with
an accuracy far greater than the im
agination can conceive.

office of the bureau of mines, gets his

to unfold, as mechanical genii, as well

in appearance, but in the mechanical
world little has been done with it outside
of a few rare experiments.
Through the investigations of the bu
reau of mines, camotite ore has been
found to contain uranium, vanadium and
radium. These first two were known
long before the presence of radium was
discovered. Uranium is used in the
manufacture of paints, and vanadium in
the construction of steel. After these
three metals are removed by a series of
crystallizations, the remaining refuse,
which is a radio-active sand?camotite is

should make it in great demand for
farmers. It tones the seed and has been
used with surprising results with to
bacco, from which there was a 75 per
cent increase cabbage, wheat, com, etc.
Only the smallest amount is necessary,
as four pounds of this energetic sand
is sufficient to mix with 800 pounds of fer
tilizer to the acre, and will cost about 40
cents per acre. Since it never loses its ac
tivity, to use it any stronger would bum
the ground. Experiments are also being
made by some of the chemical companies
of obtaining radium and the preven
tion of waste. The radium rays are also
being studied with a view to ascertain
ing their chemical effects and character
teristics.

Dr. Charles L. Parsons, hedd of the
division of mineral technology of the
bureau of mines, is enthusiastic in his
belief in the absolute success of the
work of the National Radium Institute,
and his views upon the radium situ
ation today carry the stamp of convic
tion which is the expression of a thor
ough knowledge of the subject.
In a recent interview. Pr. Parsons de
scribed the startling qualities of
radium.
"In attempting to cover the radium
situation as it exists today," he said,
"in the United States, one cannot hope
to more than skim the surface to give
a general summary of the subject. But
to understand it clearly, the physical
and chemical properties of radio-active
material and also the economic side of
the question must be briefly touched
upon. That is, the occurrence of radium
in this country, the development of the
ores and the value of radium in the
treatment of disease."
Replying to a question as to what is
meant by radio-active material. Dr.
Parsons explained:
"By radio-active material is now
generally meant substances such as
"Radium is a recent discovery, and it
is only in the initial stages of discovery
now, for no one has been able to get suf
ficient quantities to try extensive experi
ments. When Henri Becquerel, in 1800,
discovered almost through accident that
uranium and its salts possessed the prop
erty of giving off rays that affected a
photographic plate through material or
dinarily opaque, no one could realize the
effect the discovery was to have upon
our conception of matter. Of course great
interest was aroused, and all kinds of
theories were advanced as to the reason
for these radiations. One theory among
others was that the ores of uranium con
tained a new substance with unusual
properties. Prof, and Mme. Curie, work
ing upon this supposition, analyzed with
care the residues from pitch blende ore
used in the extraction of uranium, as
these residues had been shown to be
more radio-active than the ore itself.
After a series of experiments they an
nounced in 1898 the existence of a new
element, which they called radium."
* *
"What is the period of activity of ra
dium?"
"In most uranium minerals the amount
of radium present Is represented by one
part of radium to three million parts of
uranium. The half life of uranium or the
time within which one-half of any given
quantity of the element will disintegrate
into other materials is about five billion
years: while ionium, the immediate
parent of radium, has a half-life of
two hundred thousand years and radium
itself a half-life of two thousand years.
Accordingly it will be seen that although
the energy given off by these elements
in ordinary periods may appear inex
haustible, it is not really so.
"Both uranium and radium, it has been
shown, spontaneously decompose into
definite products. Already seventeen ele
ments have been positively identified,
which result from the progressive break
ing down of uranium and its decomposi
tion products."
"How are these different elements
ascertained?" Dr. Parsons was asked.
He replied:
"These radio-active elements and
others not here enumerated have been
identified and studied almost wholly
through the unprecedented amount of
spontaneous energy they evolve. This
energy is so intense that it is pos
sible to measure the amount evolved
by one-fifty millionth of a mg., or one
three^-thouaand-millionths of a grain of
radium, and even one-tenth of this
amount can be detected. These figures,
of course, are in themselves incon
ceivable, but if a piece of vradium as
large as a grain of wheat were divided
among the inhabitants of the earth it
would not only be easy to determine
whether each individual had his por
tion, but to measure the radium he
possessed. One gram of radium in
equilibrium with its disintegration
products gives off 133 calories of heat
per hour; or, in other words, sufficient
heat to raise-its own weight of water
from the melting to the boiling point
in approximately three-quarters of an
hour. During the full life of the ele
ment it would, accordingly, yield
3,700,000,000 calories?an amount of
heat which if it could be controlled
and converted into mechanical energy
without loss would run a ten-horse
power engine continuously for thirty
years. Of this energy nearly three
fourths is evolved by the decomposi
tion of the first product of radium,
which is a gas of the helium-argon
group and is known as radium emana
tion. It would require a half ton of
pure radium to yield a single pint of
this gas, but if obtained no material
is known which would not melt in
stantly if used as & container.
"The energy Iroif these radio-active
elements is manifest in three forms of
radiation, known as the alpha, beta and
gramma rays. Radium itself gives off
only alpha rays, but when thirty days
after separation from solutions contain
ing It the radium has reached a state of
equilibrium with its dissociation prod
ucts, the mixed material, which in com
merce is known as radium, yields all
three kinds of rays. ?
"The so-called alpha rays are positively
charged atoms of helium thrown off with
a velocity varying from some 8,000 to
ants of a large city. It is hard to
imagine that a single mg. of radium can
continue to give off these millions of
atoms per second for many thousands of
years without complete disintegration,
but such is actually the case."
Replying to a query as to how all
these elements and their quantities are
determined, Dr. Parsons explained that
all this was defined by the use of the
electroscope, which is an instrument de
signed for this purpose.
Radium was first produced from the
duringr the last three years the ores
mined and shipped from American de
posits have yielded more than half the
total radium production of the entire
world. This past year three times as
much radium was taken from Ameri
can deposits as from all other sources
combined. In spite of this fact there is
today available to American hospitals
less than one and a half drams of
radium .element. German hospitals, on
the other hand, are known to have ac
quired or contracted for fifteen to six
carnotite ore deposits. American car
notite is found chiefly in Montrose
and San Mifruel counties., Cal.f and
in that part of' Utah northwest
of these counties. The Utah deposits
are at Green river. Table mountain.

ores of these depoptts aire of lower

but they are n^ar to railroads and sub

Green river deposits have become reg
ular producers. In Colorado, prospects
have been opened at Coal creek, four
teen miles north of Meeker, and at
Skull creek, sixty-five miles west of
Meeker; but the richest of carnotite de
posits in America, and indeed the rich
est known radium-bearing- region in
the World, is that of Paradox valley,
Col., which extends from Hydraulic, on
the north, to the Mclntyre district on
the south. In the Paradox region the
deposits seem to lie invariably just
above the fine-grained L.a Plata sand

12,000 miles per second. This is over 2<H)
times as fast as the swiftest flight of the
fastest material thing known in space?a
shooting star. On account? of the mass
of the helium atom and the rapidity of
its flight, the alpha rays carry with them
some 05 per cent of the total energy
evolved. They apparently penetrate all
other atoms and molecules that come
within their path, but of the three rays
given off by radium they are the least
penetrating.
The alpha ray carries with it not only
the helium atom, but also two charges
of positive electricity, so that the valency
of the resulting element is diminished by
two. The energy of the alpha rays is so
great that it has been possible by at
least two distinct and separate methods
to actually count these positively charged
helium atoms as they are expelled, one
by one, from radium. So that it is known
that a single mg. of radium (or approxi
mately 1-10 the weight of the ordinary
pin head) expels every second 136,000,000
alpha particles. Indeed, the counting of
atoms of more than one form of matter
is now done with such precision that
scientists can now - count atoms as ac
curaiely a* one pan count, the inhabit
pitchblende ores of Joachimstaal, Bo
hemia, but these have fajled to yield
radium enough even for European use.
In fact radium ore has become so
valuable that the Austrian government
has expended over $600,000 for the pur
chase of the deposits, and has forbid
den exportation. Consequently, radium
ores are being sought all over the civil
ized world, and wherever prospectors
go. But they have not been found in
large quantities anywhere. Though
Austria, England. Portugal and Aus
tralia have produced some radium
bearing ores, it is now known that none
of the foreign deposits compares in ex
tent or richness with the carnotite ore
fields of Colorado and Utah.

In 1912 th? bureau of mines es
tablished a laboratory in Denver, and
sent experts into the field to study the
rare metals of the west. One of the first
things they discovered was that carno
tite was being mined and shipped
abroad from Paradox valley, in Colo
rado, and few persons realized why it
wag exported. It 18 now fcnotfn that
teen grams of radium bromide since
June, 1913, to be paid for mainly by
state and municipal appropriations.
During 1912 practically all of the ore
mined in America was shipped abroad.
In. 1913 an American company, with
headquarters at Pittsburgh, began to
 produce and market radium and up f
January 1, 1914 it has produced 1,350
mgs. of the element and shipped
to its plant a little less than half the
carnotite ore mined in this country last
year. More than half of its 1914 out
put has already been contracted for
abroad. These facts, together with the
great need of radium in American hos
pitals, led to bills being introduced in
Congress to give the government a
preferential right in the purchase of
ores mind on government land and to
provide for the extraction and purifi
cation of radium from the ores so pur
chased. But while these bills were be
ing debated in committee hearings
practically every known unlocated de
posit of the material was located either
by prospectors or by corporations in
terested. The geologists of the govern
ment and the experts of the bureau of
mines agree as tQ the location of the
There are two important ores of
radium found in t*iis country, although
carnotite is by far the most impor
tant, and more radium has already been
produced from this ore than from all
other ores put together. Carnotite is
a lemon-yellow mineral and is usual
ly found in pockets in sandstone.
Pitchblende is a hard, blucj-black ore
that looks like magnetite, but is
heavier. It is found in pockets and
veins in igneous rocks. It is not near
ly as widely distributed as carnotie.
The production of radium is certain
to increase, but the supply of radium
bearing ores is limited and no large
resources are in sight. The most favor
able estimate made by any of the em
ployes of the bureau of mines who
have been through the carnotite fields
of this country is that the known de
posits do not warrant the assumption
that more than 200 grams of radium
element will ever be produced from
them.
When it became known through the in
vestigations of the United States bureau
of mines during the latter part of 1912
that valuable radium ores were being
shipped abroad to be manufactured into
radium and sold back into this country
at prices entirely incommensurate with
those paid for the ores themselves, it
was deemed important to take prompt
measures to insure at least a portion of
this radium being available to the people
of the United States under conditions that
would prevent it continuing solely as a
rich mans remedy. This matter was
brought to the attention of Dr. Kelly
and Dr. Douglas, both of whom were
deeply interested in radium for use in
hospitals, and they immediately favored
the formation of an institute to extract
radium from American ores and to keep
the radium in this country. It was agreed
that if the ores could be procured the
radium institute would be founded and
the necessary funds supplied to work up
the raw material. These two physicians
each contributed $75,000 for the project,
and sixteen claims containing carnotite
ore in Colorado were leased on a royalty
basis under an agreement providing for
the return of the uranium and vanadium
content of the ores to the owners of the
claims. Thus the National Radium In
stitute was established. . .
As the Denver office of the bureau of
mines has been carrying on laboratory
experiments and field investigations with
reference to the uranium ores, the insti
tute proposed a co-operative agreement
with the bureau whereby the latter was
offered the opportunity of studying the
mineral concetration of the carnotite
ores and the most practical and least
wasteful methods of obtaining uranium,
radium and vanadium therefrom*</text>

the production of a grain of radium,
and because; many processes have to

From the, side of efficiency and

generally, figured at 2500 years, ac-

' 16 00 'to 3000 years. It is a law of

' (by an acid Jeach, and then the ore
'nust be 'fused with material which
helps to s break It up. The latest
method utilizes nitric acid, producing
, a radium-barium sulfate.
The plant in Paradox Valley, Color
ado, deals with ' carnotite, in which
there is abundant a large quantity of
uranium oxide.
' To give an Idea of the many pro
cesses through which the ore must go
; (before radium Is secured It Is only
i necessary to go .over a few defails. The
' ore is first ground up fine, and then
i leached with strong, hot nitric acid.
Tire product is next washed in a weak
: r add solution, ' and again - washed
;:-:' . . . '' ' 'v
with;hot distilled water. v
' When ' it ' has been . , filtered wha
comes through the filter is diluted
with ; water, and sodium hydroxid , is
added, so that radium-barium sulfate
results. There Is now still further
treatment and then the sulfates are
put, into iron pans and dried, in a hot
air 'oven. Refining follows, yielding
a sulfate free from impurities. ,
Then -this is placed with carbon in
an electric (or oil) furnace of special
design and some of which1 consume
several 'hundred kilowatts of electri
cal energy, and the sulfide is once
more treated with hydrochloric acid,
becoming radium-barium , chlorid,
from which the -barium chlorid is. ex
tracted by crystallization. Them the
radium chlorid and barium chlorid are
treated --with " ammonium carbonate
and the carbonates secured are evapo
rated, giving bromid. crystals. These
crystals are then sealed up '.in, glass'
tubes, and finally by what is termed
"higher fractionation" the radium is
separated in the4 form of radium bro
mid.;. '.;:"'. ' ' '
This is the present 'final state. Sci
'ence up to now has not succeeded in
producing, pure radium metal. '
It has' been calculated that the ra
dium in the ore is exactly or nearly
1,2.00,000,000 of the bulk so it is easy
to see that having to pass tons of ma
terial through so many delicate pro
cesses in order to 1 secure what any
one would" call a speck, of dust is a
fair reason for the great cost of the
radium when secured. v
It is now claimed, though It has not
been proved to -,the ; satisfaction of
some critics, that Tadium can be pro
duced in the United States for some
thing, less ' than $37,000 per gram,"
which,! is less . than half of what, t
cost in the open market two years
ago. ' -;. .'.'. v ..
It should not be foEgotten-in trying
to explain the cost of radium that it
costs labor to get out the ore and
that it is now valued at about $120
per ton.; - 1
There is another reason, aside from
that of production, which will go far
toward explaining the value of radium.
Just because there is so great a de
mand for it all the world over the
maret value is great," as is v the case
with any commodity , of which - the
supply Is very limited and for which
the need is great. ,
. Radium Is being used for treating
many diseases, from cancer all down
the line to minor skin affections and
inoperable diseases. Study of radium
itself has shown that there are three
main streams of rays emanating from
a bit of .radium. They have been
called the' Alpha Beta and Gamma
rays. , '
- If a maemet be held near a bit of ra
dium it will attract the Beta rays most
strongly, the Alpha ravs next, but the
Gamma rays not at all. It is of the
utmost importance to control these va
rious rays,, for while one kind are
adapted to one affection another iriaj
be required for. a second, while the
first should be shut off. It. has been
found by experiment that a thin sheet
of metal, or even a sheet of paper,
will shut; off .the Alpha rays; a much
thicker piece of metal is needed to
shut off the Beta rays, "and. the Gam
ma rays will pass through anything
but lead, and that must he of consi4-
erauie xmcKness to shut them off. .-
a sar , lor . holding .- radium . has
therefore 1 been constructed of very
heavy walls of t lead Inside the steel
chamber' so that the radium does not
escape, J or,; .rather make itself felt in
the room outside the safe. , There is
no thought of stopping the. emana
tions, for that has heretofore proved
Impossible and besides, a grain of ra
dium will outlast many generations: so
why economize in a practically inex
haustible source of energy ? ' y
The extraction . 'of', radium; properly
considered, is ; therefore only one of
the concentration of all of the stored
up energy in the JoreJnto the smallest
possible bit, and this may explain why
it is so costly. ;- ' . - ! l v,
' One of the latest preparations for
this purpose of -rendering certain ar
ticles luminous in the dark, contains
a base of zinc sulfld together with "a
small quantity of radium bromid the
alpha-particles of which continuously
bombarding the crystals of the sulfjd,

pale greenish "glow of ; about the in

radium compound included in the
paint the more ' brilliant -can this

ropean armies, the luminous com
pound employed is of such intrinsic
brilliancy that its glow can be seen

for the initial outlay in purchasing
the necessary radium. The radium

APPLICATIONS
OF RADIUM.
In the Cure of Disease and
As a Germicide.
Of what practical use in itVisthequep
tion that has repeatedly been asked
ilnco the wonders of radium became
known to the public, whose interest in
scientific discoveries usually wanes un
lets there is a satisfactory answer to this
question. Realizing this, a corresiKm
dent ot the London Times attempts to
point out some of the possible future op
plications of radium, lie remarkB at
the same time that a substance for
which a hundred tons of ore must be
worked up chemically to yield a single
ounce can never be anything but expen
sive, and (or this reason of rare and ex
ceptional use in practical applications.
Some of the most hoeful and import
ant of the uses to which radium can be
applied are in the field of medicine.
With all who use the x rays, whether
physicists or doctors, the crying com
plaint is the impossibility of regulating
the character of the rays obtained, so as
to be able to repeat with certainty any
desired result. It is for this reason that
the use of x rays in the treatment of
disease is attended capriciously some
times with beneficial and at other times
with decidedly harmful results. Rad
ium, however, gives a beautifully con
eUnt and uniform supply of rays, and
moreover possesses very many obvious
advantages. Instead of the cumbrous
focus tube nearly as large as a football,
and the manifold and expensive items
of au x ray outfit, a glass tube, some
what smaller than a toothpick, contain
ing from one-tenth to onofifth of a grain
of radium, has already been successfully
employed in the treatment of cancer.
Since the little tubes can be inserted
into cavities no bigger than the nostril,
it is obvious that a great many cases
which could not possibly bo successfully
treated with x rays can easily bu treated
by radium.
It is well known that the radium rays
have powerful germicidal actions, and
small animals like mice and caterpillars
only li.vo a few Iiouib under their infill
ence. When radium, which may bo put
in a lead Ihx an inch thick, is brought
near the forehead of a person in a dark
room, he experiences a flash of light on
the retina of tho eye, even when the
eyelids are tightly closed. The blind ap
parently experience this sensation, also,
mid hence the explanation of the rumors
that radium can make the blind see.
Hut the serious attention of medical men
is rapidly being concentrated on tho
possibilities of radium, and tho success
ful treatment of many other diseases
than cancer may be confidently expect
ed in the near future.
The great problem of the application
of radium for illuminating purposes lie
longs to the second class that is, the
application would be perfectly practical
if the supply of radium were somewhat
more abundant than it is at present. A
small fraction ot an ounce of radium,
properly employed, would probably pro
vide a good light sutllcient for several
rooms, which, at any rate during the
present century, would never need re
newal. The key to this surprising re
sult, which may not bo Iwlioved by
those who have had no opxrtunity of
exerimeul!ng for themselves, is to be
found in the fact that certain phosphor
escent substances are very ellicient ma
chines Indeed for converting the energy
of radium into visible light, whereas all
known illuminaiits, even the incandes
cent gas-light, transform only a compar
atively small projNirtion of the enurgy
they consume into the desired form, tho
greater part huiug wasted as heat.
Rutherford has calculated from his
own oxerlmenta and those of Curie that
the enurgy stored up in one gram of
radium is sufllclunt to raisu 500 tons a
mile high. An ounce would therefore
huIIIcu to drive a llfty-horse power car
at the ralo of thirty miles an hour round
the world. This possibility of our being
able in the future to control the storu of
energy in radium and to lilwrate it for
use as required at any desired rate, is of
course the most interesting feature of
radio-activity at the present time, lint
it must be confessed that science holds
out scant prospects of its fulfilment. No ,
suspicion of its ultimate accomplishment
has as yet loomed above the horizon ot
practical Kssibilities. If it ever became
possible for radium, it would almost
certainly be possible for uranium and
thorium, elements which can bu pro
duced by the ton and which probably
contain no less u store of energy than
radium, but are evolving it at</text>

RADIUM! This ciy of discovery is being
echoed in g»ol;glcal and mining circles
these days, recalling the thriving days
of gold rushes in the Yukon and Cali
fornia.
For an inky bia k mineral has been
spotted from a rushing airplane in the Cana
dian wilderness near the Arctic Ocean. In this
pitchblende ore lies hidden more radium than
now' is at work in the world, treating cancer,
unraveling the inner structure cf atoms and
peering into solid steel to discover hidden
flaws.
Over 50,000 times more precious than gold '
is radium, wonder element discovered by the
Curies. It is worth $1,500,000 an ounce: gold
is worth $27.56 an avoirdupcis ounce.
The new discovery cf radium ore in Canada
premises to break the radium monopoly of the
Belgian Kongo, just as the development of the
African deposits breke the American men poly
after the war.
This result was hardly anticipated by the
lone prospector who set out In 1929 for the
vast cold, barren wastes around the Great Bear
Lake. 800 miles from the nearest railroad.
Indeed, radium was not in his mind at all.
He knew, of course, that this, part pf Canada
contained a wealth cf valuable minerals, but
that vast deposits of radium would be found
did not occur to him.
HIGH hopes of mineral treasures in this
wilderness were entertained by a number
of adventurous spiiits. Airplanes, radios and
other paraphernalia of modern science were
employed in this geological treasure hunt.
Two companies, the Dominion Explorers
Limited and the Northern Aerial Minerals Ex
ploration Co., undeterred by the armchair ex
perts who scoffed at the idea of probab'y bring
ing minerals from the back of beyond, have
been courageously scouring this country since
1S29. They have been rewarded by the finding
of rich and substantial dep sits of copper ore.
good enough to repay the leng haul back to
civilization.
Gilbert La Bine, Canadian mining engineer,
fascinated, too, by this enigmatic frontier, de
cided to adventure on his own. In the Summer
of 1929 he flew to Great Bear Lake in the
N rlhwest Territories with Leigh Brintnell,
chief of the Western Canada Airways.
Plying over the eastern shore of the lake, he
observed, in the region of Hunter Bay and
Echo Bay, that the ground was broken up by
a great red slash of “gozzan," a rusty stain 200
feet wide caused by ir:n ore. They landed
and soon found a large vein of quartz.
This quartz vein was about 400 to 500 feet
wide end, when further investigated, proved
to be 80 miles long. Parallel with it were
found copper, ccbslt end si'ver ores.
Along the shore at Hunter Bay on Great
Bear Lake were lying immense boulders, some
of them as much as 60 tons in we'glit. They
were practically pure copper ore.
This looked hopeful. La Bine staked claims
and with his companion turned south won
deiing if perhaps the quartz contained some
gold.
THE other companies were operating by air
I fflAr.e only a few miles away. Unwilling
to let a possib'e fortune slip out of his hands.
La Bine did not wait for the thaw before re
turning. At the height of the next Winter, in
February, with nature in her unkindest mood,
he returned to Great Bear Lake again by plane.
Landing, and pushing ahead alone on snow
sfioe*. he prospected most of the eastern shore
of the lake. There was no gold, as far as he
could see; but after four mqpths he Lund on
a promontory, near where the huge quartz vein
ran into the lake, a dull, black, lusterless rock
that aroused his curiosity.
Hi thought perhaps it might be pitchblende,
the precious ore in which Pierre and Marie
Curie first discovered radium. He called the
spot “La Bine Point.”
Two months later he was jrined by Iils
brother Charles, who, with Leo Scaberg and
Shirley R. Cragg, an American engineer from
Cincinnati, had made the long trip down the
Peace, Athabasca. Slave and MacKenzie Rivers
by canoe.
The Canadian Northwest Territories, through
which they passed, 3,700,000 square miles in
expanse, the only real frontier on the North
American continent, are a vast country cf im
mense distances, m'ghty rivers and hug? lakes.
The Great Bear Lake itself is about the size
of Lake Cn'.erio, 12,000 square miles in area.
Only 12,000 people, whites, half-breeds, Indians
And Eskimos, occupy this whole region.

Along the course of the livers there are set

Hudson Eay C: and the Royal Cradian

Within reach of this help ali seems com
fortable. But for those who travel just a short
distance frcm the MacK nzie waterway starva
tion. freezing or madness is waiting.
Horrible things may happen in these lonely
places of the North, not the least of dangers
being the sleigh degs. They are part wolf, and
if a man accider.ta’ly falls, the wo'f in the deg
occasionally mtsters them and they attack. On
their journey La Bine and Cragg heard of a
child being eaten by the dcg=, and of a cclonel
of the Mounted Pcliee who, returning from a
duty tour, found that his wife had been torn
to pieces by his drgs.
At another point they were met by a strange
locking man with white hair hanging down his
back. He had been away on a trapping expe
dition but was unable to remember where he
had been or what he had seen. How' he had
lived in the Winter, when the temperature runs
from 50 to 70 degrees below zero, was a mystery.
Rapidly, however, planes and radios are en
croaching on the wilderness. Everybody flies
now in the Northwest. But this. too. has its
perils. When Cragg s party arrived at Hunter
Bay on the Great Bear Lake they found the
wreck of James Vance's plane. Misjudging
the distance to the water, he had crashed and
drowned.
With the help of planes La Bine and Cragg
were able to make several trips back ano
forth from Edmonton to the site of their find
in 13 hours, whereas the canoe trip took all
of six weeks from start to finish.
When they got back to civilization in Can
ada they took some pieces of the black ore
to the laboratories. The mineralogists told
them that it W'as a very high grade of pitch
blende containing from 30 to 80 per cent uran

ium oxide. Some of the Colorado ores con
taining only 2 to 4 per cent of uranium oxide
have been pr hi b'.v worked.
RADIUM, too, was present in the pitchblende
to the extent of 100 to 200 milligrams to
the ton. This was a~, much as the best of
Belgian ores, which .1; 1 rule the world market.
At least $7,000 worth of radiury. they were told,
was present in every ton cf the ore.
Fortunately the deposits are concentrated
and easily accessible to the surface, which Is
not true in the Kongo.
Further flights were made in February and
July until the layout of the lake shore was
thoroughly under to d. After the first discov
ery. further explorations were rewarded by the
discovery of a second pitchblende vein.
Mr. Cragg believes, however, that a "radium
rush” to Echo Bay is not likely to be profitable.
The discoverers have fully protected their de
posits by claiming all ground within striking
range of their veins for long distances. N<»e
uranium ore. in which the radium always oc
curs. other than that found by ha Bine and
his friends, has been seen.
But the radium find was not all. The silver
ore found alongside of the pitchblende has
turned out to b> of very high grade, contain
ing a relatively high per cent of the metal.
Twenty tons of pitchblende ore have already
been shipped out. and 40 more tons are now
ready for skipping.
THE two great railways of Canada are be
lieved to bs ready to build into these re
mote regions when outstanding ore bodies are
found Even with the $1.30 per pound charged
for air freight back to Edmonton it would
almost be profitable to ship the ore by air
plane.
It is beginning to lock as if these two men
had done a bigger thing for the world (and
for their new company. Eldorado Gold Mines.
Limited), than many more highly advertised
expeditions into the polar regions.
The world really needs an addition to its
meager store of radium. After all, there is less
than a peund and a half all told. About half
of this total (nine ounces, to be exact) has
been mined and purified within the borders #f
the United States.
The United States owes the development of
its radium resources particularly to one man,
Dr. Richard B. Moore. In 1911 Prof. Moore
made a speech at the opening of the Chem
ists Club in New York City. He warned his
fellow chemists that the United States was let
ting the radium industry slip out of its hands’
into foreign control.
Aroused by Dr. Moore’s remarks, the United
States Bureau af Mines sent him out to Colorado
to investigate. Three times as much radium,
he found, was being made from the carnotite
ores of Colorado and Utah as from all other
sources of radium in the world. Europe was
buying and shipping abroad these American
ores, manufacturing the radium, keeping the
bulk of it and selling small amounts back to
Americans at $70,000 a gram.
A RARE minerals laboratory under the
charge of Dr. Moore was established at
Denver to work out the best method of coax
ing the radium from the ore. At the same
time a Radium Institute was set up.
Tlie Radium Institute supplied the capital
which permitted the long preliminary work
of devising a refining process to be carried out.
The Bureau of Mines co-operated by supply
ing experts in geology and chemistry.
These efforts to give the world and the
United States a readier supply of radium weTe
completely successful. Shortly after 1913,
when the work was begun, the Denver radium
plant was producing the bulk of the world's
supply.
However, this same year witnessed the dis
covery at Katanga, in the Belgian Kongo, or
a much richer and more extensive pitchblende
deposit. This contained enough radium so
that it was profitable to ship it to Europe for
extraction.
Not, indeed, dhtil 1922 did the Belgian ra
dium appear mi the market, but when it did
it drove all other competitors out of the field.
For this reason the American workings have
been discontinued tsome think unwisely) and
the Belgian manufacturers have enjoyed a
world monopoly since then.
Resentment has been felt by doctors through
out the world that radium has not been made
more widely available for their urgent uses.
At Memorial Hospital in New York, devoted
entirely to the treatment of cancer, the eight
gram supply of radium, largest store at any
one place in the world, is used day and night.</text>

(Continued From First Page.)
portant job, is not to determine the
••purity” of a sample piece of radium
6alt, but to discover exactly what its
gamma rty strength is. This is
measured with the new ‘ gamma ray
electroscope.”
First, the test radium is placed on
a piece of gold leaf inside the device
and then the scientist, peering in per
fect safety at the sample from a dis
tance of about 10 feet, snaps a switch
that turns on an electric current
which charges the gold leaf, and as
the radiation, produced by the gamma
rays of the radium, goes through the
instrument, in which the gold leaf is
hung, it makes the air a conductor
and slowly discharges the electricity
on the gold leaf.
Since the leaf was held in an up
right position by the electric charge,
It will begm to fall as the charge leaks
off. The rate of fall is proportionate
to the strength of the gamma radia
tion. This, as we hinted earlier, is
the bureaus major test for radium
“purity.”
'ANOTHER novel device, used for a
somewhat similar purpose, is the
“emanation electroscope.” Actually it
Is so sensitive that it enables the
scientist to measure one-thousand
millionth of a gram of radium gas!
This apparatus is occasionally used
to do special jobs for medical agencies.
For instance, to measure the exact
amount of "radon,” or radium. Their
average size is so microscopic that it
is entirely invisible, not only to the
naked eye, but under the ordinary
microscope.
When using the emanation electro
scope. first the specialist forces a tiny
amount of the radium gas into the
device bv means of a vacuum pump.
Whereupon the observer, armed with
a stop-watch, times the motion of a
piece of gold leaf inside the apparatus
in similar fashion as he does when
measuring a piece of radium salt in
the bureau’s gamma-ray electroscope.
TJAVING shown you all tnese ae
■“ vices. Dr. Curtiss now takes you
to the basement of the east building
for a look at America’s queerest safe.
Never does it house money, gold or
precious documents, but instead is
used exclusively to hold a quantity
of radium barely the size of a tiny
cube less than three-eighths of an
Inch square.
Yet the door alone weighs 2.700
pounds, whereas the rest of the safe
is heavy as lead, in fact, is lead-lined
6 inches throughout its structure.
Why? Because lead shields the re
search worker from the deadly radia
tions of gamma rays.
Dr. Curtiss opens up the 10-ton
radium safe. He says it is the only
one of the kind in the entire world
and is another "brain child” of the
Bureau of Standards technicians. If
necessary it would house a tenth of
America's entire radium supply, which
at a rough guess totals about 500
grams and is worth around $22,
000.000.
You note with keenest interest the
compartments used for storage of the
test radium. These are ingeniously
arranged so that the scientist is ex
posed to the rays from one compart
ment at a time only, and even then
well within the safety range.
In front of each slide is a lead block
2 inches thick. When all the slides
are closed the scientist has 2 inches
of protective lead between himself
and all the radium in the safe, even
after he opens the outside door.
The radium itself is kept in small
wooden cases lined throughout with
half an inch of lead. The wood is
used because it protects the hands
against the dangerous secondary or
•’beta” rays.
This safe, by the way, is not the only
one used by the specialists. It is the
largest of three, and if necessary could
house 50 grams of radium. However,
the maximum amount ever kept in
tide was 7 grams.
The smallest safe Is In the center
room, or main office, of the bureau
technicians. It Is about 3 feet by 2'£
leet by 2. Ordinarily it contains about
200 milligrams, or two-tenths of a
gram. This safe Is not lead lined,
but contains lead plates for screening
off the dangerous rays.
The third, or medium-sized safe, is
kept in an adjoining office. It is
lined throughout with an inch of
lead and at present contains no ra
dium.
Vl?HEN transporting a sample of
radium from one room to an
other the Federal research worker
simply takes it out of the safe with
a pair of giant tweezers so built that
always the hands are kept 10 inches
away from the dangerous element.
Next he places it inside a queer-look
ing wooden container which at first
glance resembles an average size
violin. The lid is easily snapped on
and the radium can be carried about
In perfect safety until ready for test
ing.
The length and diameter of a com
mercial radium preparation are meas
ured as follows: First the bureau
scientist, with the aid of his "safety
tweezers,” drops the test metal into
a tiny, notch-shaped trough. Where
upon he goes into the next room, on
the opposite side of the wall, and
nakes his reading by peering at the
specimen through an enormous "pro
ector.” As the name suggests, it
irojects an enlarged image on a grad
jated screen and in such fashion
;hat the length and diameter can be
•ead immediately. For always the
ipparatus is kept in perfect focus.
Never do the Federal specialists
lave to purchase special glass vials
)r other containers in which to keep
Jieir test radium and for this rea
son: They keep most of it in the
:ontainer in which it arrives and in
;very instance the container has
iroved satisfactory in ability to resist
:he powerful gamma radiations. Most
)f the original containers, by the way,
ire not made of glass, as seems to
)e the general notion. Instead, they're
if platinum, chiefly because it’s a
fairly hard metal, Is permanent and
ion-corrosive, and isn’t affected either

T'HE major source of the world’s
supply of commercial radium is
pitchblende in the Belgian Congo. A
fairly large deposit of pitchblende was
found several years ago just above
the Arctic Circle, along Great Bear
Lake in Northern Canada. This is
being worked on a large scale as time
goes on.
In addition, a small amount of
radium today is derived from the min
eral carnotite, of which there are ex
tensive deposits in Colorado and other
parts of the United States. Although
the carnotite contains only a small
per cent of uranium and a corre
spondingly small quantity of radium,
the separation of the latter is a fairly
profitable industry, operating on a
small scale.
Carnotite is usually a light, green
ish yellow, but occasionally appears
in brownish forms. Just what is car
notiteV It is mostly the fossilized
trunks of trees, which in some remote
geological age soaked up the original
water containing the radium—maybe
millions of years ago. These tree
trunks petrified, that is, turned into
rock, thereby permanently inclosing
their radium content.
Many beautiful rock samples of
these ancient tree trunks are to be
found in Dr. Curtiss’ office. The Bu
reau of Standards is particularly proud
of owning several such, brownish red
in shade, which strikingly show the
grain of the original wood in a beau
tiful, petrified form.
Dr. Curtiss, for purposes of com
parison, showed samples of carnotite
and pitchblende. The latter Is a
lovely jet black, which no doubt ac
counts for its name.
"Lift them both,” he urged, "and
I’ll show you something interesting.”
We did so and the small piece of
pitchblende, about the size of the
palm of the hand, weighed 24>4
ounces, or a pound and a half. The
same size piece of carnotite weighed
only half a pound. This, Dr. Cur
tiss went on to explain, illustrates the
main reason why carnotite isn't being
worked very extensively for its radium
content, while pitchblende is.
Expressed more specifically, the
amount of radium present in both in
stances is proportional to the amount
of uranium compounds In the natural
ore, Dr. Curtiss says. Carnotite may
have only 10 to 15 per cent uranium
compounds, whereas pitchblende ores
may have as high as 80 to 90 per cent
uranium.
Phrased in another way: Rich car
notlte will yield from 15 to 75 milli
grams per ton of natural ore, but
pitchblende will yield from 150 to 200
milligrams per ton,
UERE'S a wee anecdote that proves
1 that a trained schnozzola may
prove of tremendous value in man's
never-failing search for radium ores:
It seems that along Great Bear Lake
in Northern Canada, where large de
posits of pitchblende are now being
worked extensively, quite a number of
native Indians are employed along
with other workmen. One day not
long ago a certain redskin walked up
to his boss forerdhn and announced
he was certain there was another large
pitchblende deposit on the shore of the
lake about a mile and a half from the
main quarry then being worked.
"What makes you so sure?" asked
the boss.
"Because,” said the Indian, “it
smells the same over there as it does
here.”
Naturally the boss didn’t take this
very seriously. However, a couple of |
days later he casually walked over the
ice to the place described by the red
skin, scraped oil a layer of snow, and,
to his surprise and delight, found that
the nose test was correct. Sure enough,
there was an additional depoait of
pitchblende.
In Washington the Federal special
ists now have on hand about one gram
of radium. The largest amount ever
in the bureau laboratories at any one
time was seven grams, back in 1931,
when the scientists were caUed upon
to test a number of thereapeutic prep
arations containing the precious metal,
for the New York State Hospital for
Malignant Diseases at Buffalo. The
research lasted three weeks and was
for the determination of gamma ray
strength only.
It takes an average of 10 days to
examine a sample of test radium,
large or small, in the Federal labora
tories. At least six days are required
to determine whether all the members
of the radium family are present in
their normal strength.
year the bureau technicians
tested about 12 grams of radium,
or over half the total import from Bel
gium; and about 16 grams during
1934. The largest amount they ever
tested in a single year was about 35
grams—in 1921. At that time radium
sold on the commercial market for
$120,000 a gram, while today the price
is only $30,000. Which means that
In 1921 those 35 grams were worth
about $4,000,0001
A possible reason for the 1921
radium “boom” might have been that
the working of the camotite products
In Colorado had hit Its peak then.
Moreover, there was a widespread
market for the metal, for up to that
time there had been very little of It
refined In the entire world. The boom
stopped within three or four years,
because it was found that camotite
could never really rank seriously In
competition with pitchblende as a
source of radium.
Recently the bureau experts tested
what Is believed to be the largest com
mercial radium preparation ever made
This was a half gram of radium sul
phate. manufactured late In 1935. The
bureau received It early last January
and kept it two weeks, making the
usual laboratory tests. Including the
most Important one with the gamma
ray electroscope. This enormous piece
of radium Is now being used by the
United States Navy for radiographing
heavy steel castings, many of them 18
Inches thick. Radiographing means
taking pictures, using radium rays for
the purpose, for determination of
structural defects, actual or potential.</text>
